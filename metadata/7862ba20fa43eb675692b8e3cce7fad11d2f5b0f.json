Produced in collaboration with Mitchell Froom, Kiko exchanged the more straightforward approach of Los Lobos' previous sessions for a uniquely textured sound, with the group's guitars thrown into sharp relief against Froom's collection of vintage tape-loop keyboards, and the arrangements are often unusually spare, most powerfully in the ghostly spaciousness of &quot;Kiko and the Lavender Moon&quot; and &quot;Wake Up Delores.&quot; Even the more full-bodied cuts, such as the rollicking &quot;That Train Don't Stop Here&quot; and the hard-rocking &quot;Whiskey Trail,&quot; boast a different personality than in Los Lobos' previous work, with the guitars clean but cutting like a switchblade and the drums snapping hard, and the more contemplative selections drip with a mysterious, otherworldly ambience that's matched by the impressionistic imagery of David Hidalgo and Louie PÃƒÂ©rez's superb songs. At its best, Kiko sounds like the musical equivalent of a Luis BuÃƒÂ±uel dream sequence, balancing beauty and menace with intelligence and a skill that's little short of dazzling; it's a brilliant, singular achievement, and the most rewarding album in the group's catalog.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7862ba20fa43eb675692b8e3cce7fad11d2f5b0f","amp;dn":"Los+Lobos+-+Kiko+%5B1992%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7862ba20fa43eb675692b8e3cce7fad11d2f5b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,98,186,32,250,67,235,103,86,146,184,227,204,231,250,209,29,47,91,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
