Baggally\nPublished: 1917\nLanguage: English\nWordcount: 18,536 / 60 pg\n\nMy friend, Mr. W. W. Baggally, an experienced investigator of supernormal phenomena, has set down some of his experiences in connexion with the subject of Telepathy, and I heartily commend his book to the public as the record of a careful, conscientious, and exceptionally skilled and critical investigator. It would be difficult to find anyone more competent by training and capacity to examine into the genuineness of these subtle and elusive phenomena, which yet are of the utmost importance in the development of psychological science. Telepathy, or the direct action of mind on mind apart from the ordinary channels of sense, opens a new chapter; it is not a coping-stone completing an erection, but a foundation-stone on which to build.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eedb3c3a11777eaf9b2c7f28b397c438798c5c7a","amp;dn":"Telepathy+Genuine+and+Fraudulent+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eedb3c3a11777eaf9b2c7f28b397c438798c5c7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,219,60,58,17,119,126,175,155,44,127,40,179,151,196,56,121,140,92,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
