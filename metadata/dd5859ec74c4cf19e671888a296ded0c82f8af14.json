The album was originally released in the United States on 15 August 1983. The album was self-produced by AC/DC and reached #4 in UK and #15 in the US. Though considered a disappointment when released, the album has been certified platinum by the RIAA.\nAfter problems with rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, drummer Phil Rudd was fired midway through the recording sessions, although he had completed his drum parts. Session drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recording, but his contributions were eventually not used. Rudd was eventually replaced by future Dio drummer Simon Wright. Wright appeared in the videos for &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; and &quot;Nervous Shakedown&quot;. He was also on the tour for the album, and noted in the pro-shot video recordings of that tour. Rudd returned to the band in 1994.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5859ec74c4cf19e671888a296ded0c82f8af14","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Flick+Of+The+Switch+%281983%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage.Sca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5859ec74c4cf19e671888a296ded0c82f8af14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,88,89,236,116,196,207,25,230,113,136,138,41,109,237,12,130,248,175,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
