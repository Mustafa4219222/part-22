Many are\nalready attuned to the standards-style trio (which may also cover modern pop\ntunes), and the free jazz trio (which is neither tethered to melody nor anchored\nin jazz sensibilities. But expectations need to be set aside when WHO Trio\nplays. The descriptive title, Less Is More, might just bear the subtitle &quot;any\nmore of this might just be too much.&quot;\n\nThis trio, featuring drummer Gerry Hemingway, Swiss pianist Michel Wintsch and\nbassist BÃƒÂ¤nz Oester, has been making music for more than 10 years now. Although\neach player has multiple side projects, their work together is both remarkable\nand quite exceptional. This is the trio's fifth recording, following The Current\nUnderneath (Leo Records, 2004).\n\nThe intelligence of this music is in its simplicity and interplay. Only a close\nworking group like WHO Trio could make this coherent a statement and not get in\neach other's way. The music, pleasing in its simplicity, samples jazz swing but\neschews its boundaries. Each player, adept at free jazz, strives to maintain the\nfocus of each thoroughly composed track. No diddling is heard hereÃ¢â‚¬â€whether\nWintsch is plucking strings inside his piano, Oester is knocking wood on his\nbass, or Hemingway is creating a myriad of sounds on his kit, they are\ncontributing to the whole composition.\n\nThe closest relation to this trio might be Keith Jarrett's Standards Trio,\ncoupled with the teamwork of the Clusone Trio, and the telepathy of a classic\nBill Evans recording. But unlike those bands, WHO Trio doesn't begin its\nexploration with covers of familiar tunes. It creates its own world, which can\nbe beautiful and moving in ballads that combine the tension and release of jazz\nwith the folk sensibility of a simple melody.\n\nFor all practical purposes this is a perfect recording.\n\n--\n\nby Kurt Gottschalk &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34098&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34098&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Stef\n\nby Massimo Ricci\n\npor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2009/06/07/who-trio-less-is-more/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2009/06/07/who-trio-less-is-more/&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Pachi Tapiz &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2009-07-01#wt_lim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2009-07-01#wt_lim&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e76c9ba7bc73c4710e6ea88e2b4e92b4e9c532d","amp;dn":"WHO+Trio+-+Less+Is+More+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e76c9ba7bc73c4710e6ea88e2b4e92b4e9c532d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,118,201,186,123,199,60,71,16,230,234,136,226,180,233,43,78,156,83,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
