Using a riot as cover he escapes. Meanwhile, Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) has bought a giraffe but it is beheaded when he tows it under a low bridge that crosses the interstate. Alan's father, angry at him for not owning up to his mistake, dies of a heart attack. After the funeral, Alan's friends Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), and Stu Price (Ed Helms) attend an intervention and Alan agrees to go to rehab in Las Vegas, but only if &quot;the Wolfpack&quot; goes with him.\n\nEn route to Las Vegas, Marshall (John Goodman) rams them off the road. He tells them that Chow stole $21 million in gold from him, and since Alan was the only one to communicate with Chow while he was imprisoned, they need to find Chow and bring him and the gold back to Marshall. Marshall takes Doug as collateral and gives the others three days to find Chow.\n\nAlan has an e-mail from Chow and they set up a meeting in Tijuana, Mexico. Stu and Phil attempt to drug Chow but when he turns on them they confess they are working for Marshall. Chow agrees to retrieve the gold from the basement of his Mexican villa. Stu, Alan and Phil go with Chow and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them. In the police station they are taken to Marshall, whose house they had just been at. Chow had lied to them: the gold was the other half that he didn't get from Marshall.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93065a433d297d22356b907fcc81d67f67ad4b2b","amp;dn":"The+Hangover+Part+III-AviCam-FULLSCREEN+VIEW-+GLOBE.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93065a433d297d22356b907fcc81d67f67ad4b2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,6,90,67,61,41,125,34,53,107,144,127,204,129,214,127,103,173,75,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
