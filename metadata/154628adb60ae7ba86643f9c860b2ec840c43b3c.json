Straight out of the gate they show as much allegiance to the mosh pit as to their Mexican roots, but it is the clever blending of the two that gives them such appeal on both sides of the border. Sometimes irreverent and humorous, this five-piece outfit comes on at times like Madness in sombreros, while at other times they tackle ballads, norteÃƒÂ±os, and straight pop ditties. Underlying it all is a cultural edge and awareness in their music that demands serious attention, albeit not at the expense of having a really good time. In the process, Cafe Tacuba carve out a diverting and singular territory all their own.
