This film is the first in a series of three films discussing various aspects of shamanism. This first film, Manifesting the Mind, is a broad look at psychedelics in general. Why are psychedelics so brutally suppressed in our culture? What exactly are some of the psychedelic plants and chemicals and how can they benefit us? With philosophy and insight from Dennis McKenna, Daniel Pinchbeck, Alex Grey, and many others, this film is not to be missed by anyone interested in psychedelics and shamanism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb54e73ddcd56216b156fb7d314429d669667903","amp;dn":"Manifesting+The+Mind","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb54e73ddcd56216b156fb7d314429d669667903","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,84,231,61,220,213,98,22,177,86,251,125,49,68,41,214,105,102,121,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
