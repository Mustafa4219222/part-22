This post-punk DIY bricolage uses material generated by the fans and musicians themselves, on a multitude of formats and over the history of ATP, to capture the uncompromising spirit of a parallel music universe. All TomorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Parties was created by All TomorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s People and Jonathan Caouette.\n\nI ripped this to my computer and converted the VOB files to avi using a free programme ...
