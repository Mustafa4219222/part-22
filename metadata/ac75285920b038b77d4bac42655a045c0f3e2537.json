Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nSequel reissued the bulk of Gene Pitney's '60s albums for Musicor as a series of compact discs that contains two original albums each. Although the material on each disc is different, one basic pattern does emerge -- by and large, the singles were the best songs on each album, but the remaining songs, usually comprised of solid album tracks, covers and filler, are generally interesting to hardcore fans, since Pitney has such a uniquely dramatic voice. In other words, most fans will be satisfied by one of the many hits collections, but these discs are essential for serious fans and collectors.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/blue-gene-gene-meets-the-fair-young-ladies-r258661&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/blue-gene-gene-meets-the-fair-young-ladies-r258661&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=========\n\nBlue Gene\nAMG Review by Donald A. Guarisco\n\nThis 1963 album found Gene Pitney pursuing the blend of rock, pop, and pre-rock ballads that defined his unique style. The big highlight of this album is &quot;Twenty Hours From Tulsa,&quot; a guilt-wracked Burt Bacharach/Hal David narrative about a man who strays from fidelity just 24 hours shy of reaching his true love. This song blended Pitney's operatic sense of vocal drama with a unique melody, combining country guitar twang and Latin-styled horn arrangements to create an international pop hit. Other memorable tracks on Blue Gene include &quot;Yesterday's Hero,&quot; which layers dramatic horns over an unusual tango-styled melody to back up its story of a forgotten lover, and &quot;Half the Laughter, Twice the Tears,&quot; a hard-hitting &quot;beat ballad&quot; about a cheater's remorseful second thoughts that uses some surprising heavy fuzz guitars in its punchy arrangement. ...\n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/blue-gene-r15283/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/blue-gene-r15283/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========\n\nMeets the Fair Young Ladies of Folkland\nAMG Review by Donald A. Guarisco\n\nOn Meets the Fair Young Ladies of Folkland, Gene Pitney puts aside the operatic pop grandeur that normally defined his recordings for a set of tunes that pursued folk and country styles with bare bones arrangements. The end result is interesting but not entirely successful. The first problem is that Pitney's vocal style is best suited to dramatic narratives like &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart&quot; or gentle ballads like &quot;Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart&quot; and thus he sounds a bit uneasy on this album's comedic, novelty-styled folk tunes. Songs like &quot;Lyda Sue Whad'ya Do?&quot; and &quot;Those Eyes of Liza Jane&quot; suffer because Pitney's vocals are too mannered to give the songs the sly comic touch they require. Meets the Fair Young Ladies of Folkland is also a less compelling listen than Pitney's other albums because it trades the diverse genre blends and lush production of his straightforward pop output for a singular folk/country sound put forward with minimalist production. Despite these stylistic problems, ...\n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/meets-the-fair-young-ladies-of-folkland-r46752/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/meets-the-fair-young-ladies-of-folkland-r46752/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTT&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
