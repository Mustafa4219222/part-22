Ethan Vance has just played his last game as a collegiate soccer star. They're sharp, hungry for success, and they share a secret.\n\nLast night, Ethan and Mia met at a bar, and, well . . . one thing led to another, which led to them waking up the next morning - together. Things turned awkward in a hurry when they found themselves sharing a post hookup taxi . . . to the same place: Boomerang headquarters.\n\nWhat began as a powerful connection between them is treated to a cold shower courtesy of two major complications. First, Boomerang has a strict policy against co-worker dating. And second, they're now competitors for only one job at the end of summer.\n\nAs their internships come to an end, will they manage to keep their eyes on the future and their hands off each other, or will the pull of attraction put them right back where they started?\n\nE-Book : Rebound [Boomerang, #02]\nAuthor : Noelle August\nLanguage : English\nPublisher : William Morrow Paperbacks\nISBN-10 : 0062331086\nISBN-13 : 978-0062331083\n\nHooking up is only the beginning of the fun in this sexy and irresistible second installment of the thrilling New Adult series, Boomerang.\n\nAdam Blackwood has it all. At twenty-two, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fabulously wealthy, Ryan Gosling-hot and at the top of the heap in the business world. His life is perfect, until a scandal from his past resurfaces and knocks the tech wunderkind down, throwing his company, Boomerang, a hook-up site for millennials, into chaos.\n\nThree years ago, Adam married his high school loveÃ¢â‚¬â€and then lost her in a tragic accident. Now, the heartbreak and guilt heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tried to bury with work and women begins to take over his life.\n\nAlison Quick, the twenty-one-year-old daughter of a business tycoonÃ¢â‚¬â€and the very ex-girlfriend of BoomerangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former intern, EthanÃ¢â‚¬â€has a problem of her own. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got one chance to prove to her father that she deserves a place in his empire by grabbing control of Boomerang and taking Adam down.\n\nBut as Alison moves in on him, armed with a cadre of lawyers and accountants, she discovers thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s much more to Adam and Boomerang than meets the eye. Will earning her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s approval come at the price of losing her first real love? It appears so, unless Adam can forgive her for wrecking his life and trying to steal his livelihood. But Alison hopes that old adage is right.
