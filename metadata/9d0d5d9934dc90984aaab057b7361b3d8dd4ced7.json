Included in the &quot;fitness books and videos&quot; PDF are links to high quality fitness resources,that I specifically chose for martial artists. There are plenty of functional exercises to help build stamina as well as functional, explosive strength. Martial arts specific routines are also linked to. The &quot;Overcoming Gravity&quot; PDF has three pages of my personal notes about the book - including some tips on how to study it, constructing your own workbook based on the progression charts, and other bits of advice. Lastly, the &quot;Strength and Fitness&quot; guide contains articles that I personally wrote for the benefit of my martial arts students. Now, you get to benefit from it as well!
