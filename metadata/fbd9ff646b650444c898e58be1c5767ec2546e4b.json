A covert counter-terrorist unit called Black Cell, headed by the duplicitious and suave Gabriel Shear, wants the money to help finance their raise-the-stakes vengeance war against international terrorism, but it's all locked away behind super-encryption. He brings in convicted hacker Stanley Jobson, who only wants to see his daughter Holly again but can't afford the legal fees, to slice into the government mainframes and get the money. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n   [FORMAT]:.......................[ MP4\n\n\n   [GENRE]:........................[ Action | Thriller | Crime \n\n\n   [FILE SIZE] 650MB\n\n\n   [RESOLUTION] 1280*528\n\n\n   [ASPECT RATIO] 2.40:1\n\n\n   [FRAME RATE] 23.976 fps\n\n\n   [LANGUAGE ] English\n\n   \n   [RUNTIME] 1h 39mn\n\n   [SOURCE] 720p\n\n\n\n\n\n            ------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    !!!
