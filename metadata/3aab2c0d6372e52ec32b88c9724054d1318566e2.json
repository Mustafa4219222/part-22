Mourners of the late, great Sopranos will meet a new kind of mob as two rival schoolyard gangs struggle for supremacy. Their world is also being captured by an unseen Documentarian, voiced by Paul Gross (one of the miniseries' executive producers), providing both &quot;behind the scenes&quot; footage and interviews with the kids intercut with the main drama.\n\nA short promo clip is here:\n\n\n--- File Information --- \nFile Name:            The.Yard.S01E01.WS.XviD-err0001.avi\nFile Size:            244,412,416 bytes\n\n--- Video Information --- \nCodec:                XVID\nDuration:             27:36.975\nFrame Width:          624\nFrame Height:         352\nFramerate:            23.976 fps\nBitrate:              1057 kbps\n\n--- Audio Information --- \nCodec:                0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate:          48000 Hz\nBitrate:              110 kbps\nBitrate Type:         VBR\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aab2c0d6372e52ec32b88c9724054d1318566e2","amp;dn":"The+Yard+S01E01+WS.XviD-err0001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aab2c0d6372e52ec32b88c9724054d1318566e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,171,44,13,99,114,229,46,195,43,136,201,114,64,84,209,49,133,102,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
