In part one you'll learn how to use the body's own biology to put yourself in a subconscious focus without using any mental visualizations. This shortens the learning curve immensely and you very well may have an OBE or lucid dream the very first time you use the methods in this DVD. Part two covers more advanced methods in which you can take command of your lucid dreaming by doing Wake Induced Lucid Dreams or WILDs. You'll learn a powerful visualization called a teleporting OBE exit that you can use to do a WILD, you'll also learn how to craft your own efficient visualizations. In Part 1 you'll learn how to: (1) Speak the body's biological language so you can to give it the commands to fall asleep while you keep your mind awake. (2) Tell how deep in trance you are by listening to the body's signals. (3) Optimize your brain chemistry to make lucid dreams much more likely and much more vivid. (4) Have dozens of lucid dreams or OBEs rapidly one after the other. (5) Fall asleep quickly but without falling so far asleep that you can't become lucid. (6) Conquer fear in dreams. In Part 2 you'll learn how to: (1) Create a space in your subconscious that you can immerse your focus into to have a WILD (2) Shift your focus into the part of your brain that generates mental imagery and away from the physical imagery you usually see (3) Craft your own efficient visualizations to develop solid subconscious spaces (4) Fix blindness in lucid dreams and sense your surroundings without using vision (5) Solve relaxation problems such as involuntary muscle twitching, itching and the swallow reflex\r\n\r\nPart 1: You'll learn how to:\r\n\r\n* Speak the body's biological language so you can to give it the commands to fall asleep while you keep your mind awake.\r\n\r\n* Tell how deep in trance you are by listening to the body's signals.\r\n\r\n* Optimize your brain chemistry To make lucid dreams much more likely and much more vivid.\r\n\r\n* Have dozens of lucid dreams or OBEs rapidly one after the other.\r\n\r\n* Fall asleep quickly but without falling so far asleep that you can't become lucid.\r\n\r\n* Conquer fear in dreams.\r\n\r\nPart 2: You'll learn how to:\r\n\r\n* Create a space in your subconscious that you can immerse your focus into to have a WILD\r\n\r\n* Shift your focus into the part of your brain that generates mental imagery and away from the physical imagery you usually see\r\n\r\n* Craft your own efficient visualizations to develop solid subconscious spaces\r\n\r\n* Fix blindness in lucid dreams and sense your surroundings without using vision\r\n\r\n* Solve problems associated with relaxation such as involuntary muscle twitching, itching and the swallow reflex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e32d5a6d801e98b72a4bce5ee35cd7fc873dcfb3","amp;dn":"How+To+Lucid+Dream+And+Have+Out+Of+Body+Experiences","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e32d5a6d801e98b72a4bce5ee35cd7fc873dcfb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,45,90,109,128,30,152,183,42,75,206,94,227,92,215,252,135,61,207,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
