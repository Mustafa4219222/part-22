A fugitive undercover cop framed for murder, and now hunted by cops and the mob. Max is a man with his back against the wall, fighting a battle he cannot hope to win.\n\nMax Payne is a relentless story-driven shooter about a man on the edge, fighting for his justice while uncovering plot-twists and twisted thugs in the gritty bowels of New York during the century's worst blizzard. Using the innovative Bullet Time mechanic, players can slow their sense of time in order to focus shots in intense encounters for deadly accuracy in life-or-death gun duels.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bae6cc87902ee0567b4995ce7cc389fdeb3e789","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bae6cc87902ee0567b4995ce7cc389fdeb3e789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,174,108,200,121,2,238,5,103,180,153,92,231,204,56,159,222,179,231,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
