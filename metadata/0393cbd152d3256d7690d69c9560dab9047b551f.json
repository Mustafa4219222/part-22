The son of musicians, brother to Mory Kante and cousin to Kante Manfila, he has a rich heritage and a deep sense of tradition. He also has an exploratory mind. In his previous work, Sobindo, he fused electronics and various musical styles into his Manding heritage to great effect, but this new recording is a quiet, contemplative, but no less daring exploration. Don't let the title confuse you, this is not a fusion flamenco project, but an investigation into the north African music that gives rise to the Moorish music of Spain. This is an all-acoustic project, concentrating on Moussa Diawara's voice and kora. In fact, as much as it seems like there are guitars, percussion, and bass adding to the sound, this is achieved almost exclusively by the kora, a testament to the innovative technique and incredible skill of this artist.\n-- amazon.com\n\nThese guys are obviously Buena Vista Social Club fans. Kora Jazz Trio Part 3 includes a cover of Buena Vista's Chan Chan and here Diawara does a rip off, or rather a homage, to Buena Vista's El Carretero in track 6, M'Dianamo. What can I say? It's just lovely. Imitation is the best compliment there is.\n\nTracks\n01- Almany\n02- Dakan\n03- Democratie\n04- Flamenkora\n05- Sabary\n06- M'Dianamo\n07- Kana Mone\n08- Sabou\n09- Moya\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0393cbd152d3256d7690d69c9560dab9047b551f","amp;dn":"Djeli+Moussa+Diawara+-+FlamenKora+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0393cbd152d3256d7690d69c9560dab9047b551f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,147,203,209,82,211,37,109,118,144,214,156,149,96,218,185,4,123,85,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
