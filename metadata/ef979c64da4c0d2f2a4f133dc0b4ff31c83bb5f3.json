It was the debut single of their 1990 debut album Shake Your Money Maker, reaching the 75th position on the Billboard Hot 100 and the 5th position on the Mainstream Rock charts.\n\nA music video directed by Pete Angelus was shot to promote the single, and the song was included on the greatest hits compilation Greatest Hits 1990Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1999: A Tribute to a Work in Progress. An acoustic rendition of the song is also featured on the band's latest, greatest hits-like Croweology album.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the Black Crowes filed a lawsuit against country singer Gretchen Wilson, claiming that she infringed upon their copyright for the song &quot;Jealous Again.&quot; The suit also includes claims against her label, her publisher, and TNT, who is using the song in promotional commercials. They claim that Wilson copied the Crowes hit when she recorded &quot;Work Hard, Play Harder.&quot;\n\nThe Black Crowes are an American rock band formed in 1989. Their discography includes nine studio albums, four live albums and several charting singles. The band was signed to Def American Recordings in 1989 by producer George Drakoulias and released their debut album, Shake Your Money Maker, the following year. The follow-up, The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion, reached the top of the Billboard 200 in 1992.\n\nAfter a hiatus between 2002 and 2005, the band released Warpaint, which hit number 5 on the Billboard chart. After the release of a double album, the greatest hits-like and mostly acoustic Croweology in August 2010, the band started a 20th anniversary tour that was followed by an ongoing second hiatus.\n\nThe band has opened for various rock acts such as Heart, Robert Plant, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Dave Matthews Band, the Grateful Dead, Aerosmith and ZZ Top, and performed live with Jimmy Page and Oasis, among others. The band has sold over 30 million albums, and is listed at number 92 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. They were also labeled by Melody Maker as &quot;The Most Rock 'n' Roll Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World&quot; and the readers of Rolling Stone voted them 'Best New American Band' in 1990.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jealous_Again_(The_Black_Crowes_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jealous_Again_(The_Black_Crowes_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BANkjaadg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BANkjaadg&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:04:29\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
