New York, PublicAffairs \n\n288 Pages\nISBN: 161039173X \nRetail Epub\n\nI have included in this torrent the original retail Epub plus two conversions to MOBI and PDF.\n\n..................................................................\n\n\nFrom amazon: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Girls-Revolt-Workplace/dp/161039173X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353457742&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+good+girls+revolt&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Girls-Revolt-Workplace/dp/161039173X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353457742&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+good+girls+revolt&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIt was the 1960sÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œa time of economic boom and social strife. Young women poured into the workplace, but the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Help WantedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ ads were segregated by gender and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mad MenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ office culture was rife with sexual stereotyping and discrimination.\n\nLynn Povich was one of the lucky ones, landing a job at Newsweek, renowned for its cutting-edge coverage of civil rights and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Swinging Sixties.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nora Ephron, Jane Bryant Quinn, Ellen Goodman, and Susan Brownmiller all started there as well. It was a top-notch jobÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œfor a girlÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œat an exciting place.\n\nBut it was a dead end. Women researchers sometimes became reporters, rarely writers, and never editors. Any aspiring female journalist was told, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you want to be a writer, go somewhere else.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nOn March 16, 1970, the day Newsweek published a cover story on the fledgling feminist movement entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Women in Revolt,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ forty-six Newsweek women charged the magazine with discrimination in hiring and promotion.  It was the first female class action lawsuitÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe first by women journalistsÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œand it inspired other women in the media to quickly follow suit.\n\nLynn Povich was one of the ringleaders. In The Good Girls Revolt, she evocatively tells the story of this dramatic turning point through the lives of several participants. With warmth, humor, and perspective, she shows how personal experiences and cultural shifts led a group of well-mannered, largely apolitical women, raised in the 1940s and 1950s, to challenge their bossesÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œand what happened after they did. For many, filing the suit was a radicalizing act that empowered them to Ã¢â‚¬Å“find themselvesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and fight back. Others lost their way amid opportunities, pressures, discouragements, and hostilities they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t prepared to navigate.  \n\nThe Good Girls Revolt also explores why changes in the law didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t solve everything. Through the lives of young female journalists at Newsweek today, Lynn Povich shows what hasÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œand hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œchanged in the workplace.\n \n\nSome reviews:\n\nGloria Steinem\nThe Good Girls Revolt is as compelling as any novel, and also an accurate, intimate history of new women journalists invading the male journalistic world of the 1970s. Lynn Povich turns this epic revolt into a lesson on why and how we've just begun.\n\nJeannette Walls\nA meticulously reported and highly readable account of a pivotal time in the womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s movement.\n \nKirkus\nPovichÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in-depth research, narrative skills and eyewitness observations provide an entertaining and edifying look at a pivotal event in womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history.\n\nNew York Times\nThe personal and the political are deftly interwoven in the fast-moving narrativeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. The Good Girls Revolt has many timely lessons for working women who are concerned about discrimination todayÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.But this sparkling, informative book may help move these goals a tiny bit closer.\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLynn Povich began her career at Newsweek as a secretary.
