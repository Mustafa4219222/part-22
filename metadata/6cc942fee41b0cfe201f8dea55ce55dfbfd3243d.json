In other words, it's a modern-day Transport Tycoon with procedural content and a sophisticated city simulation.\n\n&quot;ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the year 1850, and there are great times ahead! Establish a transport company and be its manager. Build infrastructure such as railways and stations, purchase transportation vehicles and manage lines. Fulfill the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needs and watch cities evolve dynamically.\n\nTrain Fever runs on an engine specifically developed for this game. The engine has a great innovative scope and is specialized in procedural content and urban simulation. A key point is the fact that there is no grid that game objects have to be aligned to, allowing for a great degree of freedom.\n\n\n\n    Features:\n\n    Randomly generated, modifiable terrain with realistic dimensions\n    Advanced passenger simulation\n    Dynamically simulated urban development\n    Procedurally generated buildings\n    No grid - that is, the game world is not limited to 90 (or 45) degree angles\n    Vehicles from more than 150 years of transportation history\n    Passenger and freight transport\n    Achievements and experience points\n    Detailed 3D graphics\n    Freely adjustable zoom factor\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nPC System Requirements\nMinimum:\nOS: Windows Vista, 7 or 8\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nGraphics: Nvidia GeForce 8800 512 MB, ATI Radeon HD 3850 512 MB\nAdditional Notes: Mouse with wheel\n\n\n Change log:\n\n\nBuild 4221 (September 4)\n\n    Fixed a bug which allowed the camera to go underwater\n    Fixed train top speed achievements (were not unlocked before)\n    Fixed sky box bottom texture\n    Improved welcome window\n    Improved German und Hungarian translations\n\n\nBuild 4234 (September 6)\n\n    Fixed a texture compression bug which caused very long loading times and freezes when using any build tool for the first time (was present on certain systems with ATI graphics cards)\n    Improved crash dump information feedback (if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t disable it, crash dumps are sent automatically to us, without any personal data of course, and thanks to this improvement we will be able to solve crashes and performance issues much better in the next days)\n\n\n- Extract\n- Copy crack from TrainFever.v4234.rar to your installdir\n- Play\n     \n   Block game exe in your firewall to prevent the game from trying to go\n   online ..\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc942fee41b0cfe201f8dea55ce55dfbfd3243d","amp;dn":"Train+Fever+Update+Only+%5Bv4221%5D+to+%5Bv4234%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc942fee41b0cfe201f8dea55ce55dfbfd3243d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,201,66,254,228,27,12,254,32,31,141,234,85,206,85,223,191,211,36,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
