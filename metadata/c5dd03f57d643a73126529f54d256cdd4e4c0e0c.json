Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount of input from Jack Kirby,[1] the character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964).\n\nDaredevil is notable as being among the few superheroes with a disability, being blinded as a youth in a radioactive accident that also drastically heightened his remaining senses and gave him a &quot;radar-sense&quot; allowing him to perceive his surroundings. His public identity is Matt Murdock, a successful attorney-at-law.\n\nAlthough Daredevil had been home to the work of many legendary comic-book artists ÃƒÂ¢?? Everett, Kirby, Wally Wood, John Romita, Sr., and Gene Colan, among others ÃƒÂ¢?? it is Frank Miller&amp;#039;s influential tenure on the title in the late 1970s and early 1980s that is best remembered, cementing the character as a popular and individual part of the Marvel Universe. \n\nI am uploading some miniseries of Daredevil in addition to my Daredevil v1. Earlier I intended to be a complete miniseries and One Shots torrent, but now I am dividing into two. Daredevil One Shots will follow after this is sufficiently seeded.\n\nMiniseries include\n1.Elektra\n2.Father\n3.Man Without Fear\n4.Ninja\n5.Punisher\n6.Redemption\n7.Spider-Man\n8.Yellow\n\nEnjoy and Seed.
