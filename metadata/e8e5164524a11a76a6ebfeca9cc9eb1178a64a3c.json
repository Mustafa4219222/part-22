Lederman and science writer Dick Teresi.\nThe book provides a brief history of particle physics, starting with the Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Democritus, and continuing through Isaac Newton, Roger J. Boscovich, Michael Faraday, and Ernest Rutherford and quantum physics in the 20th century.\nLederman said he gave the Higgs boson the nickname &quot;The God Particle&quot; because the particle is &quot;so central to the state of physics today, so crucial to our final understanding of the structure of matter, yet so elusive,but jokingly added that a second reason was because &quot;the publisher wouldn't let us call it the Goddamn Particle, though that might be a more appropriate title, given its villainous nature and the expense it is causing.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e5164524a11a76a6ebfeca9cc9eb1178a64a3c","amp;dn":"The+God+Particle-+Higgs+Boson+Mission+explained+by+Leon+M.+Leder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e5164524a11a76a6ebfeca9cc9eb1178a64a3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,229,22,69,36,161,26,118,166,235,254,202,156,201,235,17,120,166,74,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
