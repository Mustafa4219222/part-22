And some of it was. But that is not the whole story. \n\nThere were other groups formed under the same umbrella. \n\nThese broke into two strands. One was farmers and labourers\nworking remoter parts of Britain who were enlisted, trained\nin sabotage, demolition &amp; assassination, provided with arms\nin underground dumps, and sent back to their day jobs. They\nwould have been activated should Axis forces have landed, and\nwould have formed the backbone of armed resistance should the\ngovernment surrender.\n\nThe other strand was a politicised group, similarly trained, who\nwould have gone into action should it look like the Halifax persuasion\nwas going to take power and sue for peace. They were to take out\nkey people and potential collaborators [such as Mosley]. Michael Foot\nsaid that his first job would have been to kill Halifax.\n\nA problem with empowering secret armies is that they sometimes get\nideas of their own.\n\nThis documentary is part of the story. Over the next few years\nwe should get much more of it.\n.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583576d74618886460884715fcc1b25ae6b9af17","amp;dn":"BBC+R4+Documentary+-+%5C%27Dads%5C%27+Revolutionary+Army%5C%27+sp7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583576d74618886460884715fcc1b25ae6b9af17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,53,118,215,70,24,136,100,96,136,71,21,252,193,178,90,230,185,175,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
