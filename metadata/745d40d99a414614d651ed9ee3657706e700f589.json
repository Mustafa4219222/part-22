He summons Monocyte, a forgotten immortal necromancer who long ago chose sleep in his failed quest to die. With a fatal pact sealed, Monocyte strikes out as Azrael's vicious proxy.\n\nThe comic itself is very demanding and requires commitment from the reader, both in story and visually.\n\nThe detail in the bi-monthly 4 part series is outstanding, and is enhanced further by the two small additional stories included at the back of the comic. 'Chronicles of the Shepherd' is also written by Ghanbari and illustrated by Riley Rossmo and illustrates how the humans are farmed. 'Chronicles of the Messenger' is written and illustrated by David Stoupakis', and tells of a young girl Beatrice taken to see a Doctor due to her 'imagination'. Beatrice can see the immortals and understands the human role in their society. Although kept over night the final panel shows he in the described barren land alongside the adult Beatrice discussed in the main story.\n\nJUST READ IT...\n\nMONOCYTE # 01-04\n\nALL HIGH QUALITY SCANS\n\nPUBLISHED BY IDW\n\nENJOY AND SEED...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:745d40d99a414614d651ed9ee3657706e700f589","amp;dn":"MONOCYTE+%28+COMPLETE+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"745d40d99a414614d651ed9ee3657706e700f589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,93,64,217,154,65,70,20,214,81,237,158,227,101,119,6,231,0,245,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
