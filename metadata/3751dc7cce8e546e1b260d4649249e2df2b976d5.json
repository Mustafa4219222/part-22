It includes 5 titles...\n\n * 2005 - Hood Gospel, Vol 1\n * 2009 - Dream Big\n * 2009 - Mic Check - MJ Dedication\n * 2009 - T-Haddy vs T-Pain\n * 2012 - Hood Gospel, Vol 2\n\nIf you like listening to music with quality beats AND a positive message then T Haddy is the artist for you. His sound is unique and has landed him in a niche all his own. He has masterfully mixed Urban Gospel with Holy Hip Hop, spliced in some Rhythm and Praise and rounded it out with Neo Soul Worship. What is more important, is the message behind his music. His mission is to reach GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s people and draw them closer to Him through his gift.\n\nIn Christ,\nTorrentTracts - September 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3751dc7cce8e546e1b260d4649249e2df2b976d5","amp;dn":"T-Haddy+Discography+2005-2012+%285+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3751dc7cce8e546e1b260d4649249e2df2b976d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,81,220,124,206,142,84,110,27,38,13,70,73,36,158,45,242,185,118,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
