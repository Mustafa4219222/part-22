But the group has some annoying weaknesses, notably a tendency toward lyrical abstraction. In addition, the imagination that inspired the slick ragtime jazz (with vaudeville overtones) of Sheer Heart Attack&amp;#039;s &quot;Bring Back That Leroy Brown&quot; becomes obsessive on A Night at the Opera, where the same stylistic idea is reworked into three songs. But ultimately, the group&amp;#039;s willingness to experiment, even when they fail, makes them interesting.\n\n\nThey have the ability to write first-rate pop/rock songs. Guitarist Brian May&amp;#039;s &quot;&amp;#039;39&quot; is his best attempt yet at Paul McCartney-style crooning, but it&amp;#039;s on side two that the vocals really take command. On &quot;The Prophet&amp;#039;s Song,&quot; the best track, May&amp;#039;s powerful guitar perfectly complements the rich, multi-tracked harmonies of lead singer Freddie Mercury. Throughout the record, the group makes the most effective use of vocal rounds, choruses and harmonies in the heavy-rock genre since Argent&amp;#039;s Ring of Hands.\n\nLike all heavy-metal groups, Queen&amp;#039;s most easily distinguished trait is a knack for manipulating dynamics. But what sets them apart is their selection of unlikely effects: acoustic piano, harp, acapella vocals, no synthesizers. Coupled with good songs, Queen&amp;#039;s obviously the strongest contender in this field.\n\n- Kris Nicholson, Rolling Stone, 4-8-76. \n\nThis is the DVDA version of that classic album, featuring dts and pcm stereo soundtracks, remix\n\ned by Brian May. The dts 5.1 surround sound reflects the true nature of Queen&amp;#039;s music; multi-layered vocals, guitars and atmosherics coming from all sides. Just listen to &quot;Prophet&amp;#039;s Song&quot; to hear what I mean. A classic in every respect.\n\n\nNo Amazon or IMDB link, but here&amp;#039;s a linkto Play.com:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=DVDA&amp;title=138606&amp;pa=rnr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=DVDA&amp;title=138606&amp;pa=rnr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDetails\n\nTracks -    1.
