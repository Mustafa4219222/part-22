Cant wait for ya to get back in action. Continuing the legacy of great quality, KiNGDOM releases... Well, Did a little bit on this like fised AR, lowered the blue as much as I could without discoloring other portians. I added a little sharpeness to the script, also increased the brightness and Gamma. The audio seemed low so I raised it to 120%. Video and audio really wasnt all that bad to begin with, just needed a lil more and a lil less.  TAKE IT or LEAVE IT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05953da4ebcac5070bf0625e05e8ec3a959f1217","amp;dn":"Dinner+for+Schmucks+CAM+XViD-KiNGDOM+%28Kingdom-Release%29+%5BTZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05953da4ebcac5070bf0625e05e8ec3a959f1217","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,149,61,164,235,202,197,7,11,240,98,94,5,232,236,58,149,159,18,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
