Although it's better to hear most of these artists' work in its original context, this sampler does an excellent job of creating its intended mood, and it's a pretty strong listen as well. ~ Steve Huey, AMG\n\nVA Love Ballads: Late Night Jazz Tracks:\n01  Jim Hall - Sazanami \n02  Dave Brubeck - Lullaby \n03  Mel Torme - A Lovely Way to spend an Evening \n04  Gary Mulligan - My funny Valentine \n05  Jeanie Bryson - Some Cats Know \n06  Jacques Loussier - Gymnopedie No.1 \n07  Oscar Peterson - Love Ballade \n08  Jeremy Davenport - I Thought About You \n09  Andre Previn - Laura \n10  Lionel Hampton - God Bless The Child \n11  Ray Brown - But Beautiful \n12  George Shearing - How Beautiful is Night \n13  Joe Williams - Here's to Life \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:792686012ae7ff4f572ddb6a3428434c824cad96","amp;dn":"VA+Love+Ballads%3A+Late+Night+Jazz+%281999%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"792686012ae7ff4f572ddb6a3428434c824cad96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,38,134,1,42,231,255,79,87,45,219,106,52,40,67,76,130,76,173,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
