Because she has no other family members in the NT, she is sent to live with her uncle, aunt and cousin (Snook) in Tasmania.\n\nSnook and Jars quickly become friends, and along with Quenton Quigley, the annoying but not altogether bad son of the mayor of the area, they have an adventure when they go camping in the forest with Snook's father. Jars meets the Forest Spirit - an apparition that has appeared in her dreams and now asks for her help to uncover a secret in the Tasmanian bush.\n\nJars, her cousin Snook and the bumbling Quenton Quigley begin and adventure in the wilderness that takes many unexpected twists and turns!\n\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of book two, Forest Shadows, we find Jars and Snook accused of a crime of which they are, of course, innocent. To prove their innocence, with the help of Shadow, who is now JarsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ dog, they embark on another exciting adventure. A continuity of characters from book one, with a continuation the mystical theme and the hint of another kind of celestial visitor will please readers of Forest Spirit. Forest Shadows however, like Forest Spirit, will also stand on its own as a childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventure that will stand the test of time.\n\n\n\n\nA Rhotosaurus, a phantom kid, a ghost mountain and a Bushman Extraordinaire called Reginald Blowhard, all come together to form David Laing's latest tale, Forest Secrets the third book of his trilogy for young adults. The protagonist is a young Aboriginal girl called Jars, who, along with her faithful dog, Shadow and her tearaway cousin, Snook, embark on an adventure neither will forget.On an impulse, they enter the Cray Bay Photographic competition, which takes them to the Gorge Camping Ground. And that is when their plans are shattered - by an eerie and sudden darkness that comes over the gorge. But that's not all - they are visited by a cheeky possum called Charlie, their bothersome camping companion and Reginald Blowhard finds himself in strife in lots of ways, and, along the way, our heroes just happen to discover The Find of the Century.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9055c9252171c80bc329177df3ec8d815eff55b","amp;dn":"Forest+Trilogy+by+David+Laing+%28Complete%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9055c9252171c80bc329177df3ec8d815eff55b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,5,92,146,82,23,28,128,188,50,145,119,223,62,200,216,21,239,245,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
