Although there are some gaps according to the dates, this is the complete series according to comicstriplibrary.org. The second run starting in 1924 is not included.\n\n(2) These strips are all in the public domain. So if anyone accuses you of only using bittorrent to violate copyright, you can show them this.\n\n(3) The files are in .cbr format, which is designed for reading comics. You can find lots of free readers for these files, if you're new at this. Here's a list:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zcultfm.com/~comic/wiki/index.php/Comic_Viewers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zcultfm.com/~comic/wiki/index.php/Comic_Viewers&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSome pdf readers can also interpret them. But if for some reason you can't read them like this, it's easy to fix. A .cbr file is just a RAR-format archive of image files. Rename each file's name extension to .rar, then open it using an archive manager and extract the individual cartoons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a358101f276d1decf98c8f7814aa5fa3577679","amp;dn":"Little+Nemo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a358101f276d1decf98c8f7814aa5fa3577679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,163,88,16,31,39,109,29,236,249,140,143,120,20,170,95,163,87,118,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
