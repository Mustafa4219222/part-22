Meanwhile, Mrs Doyle fears redundancy when the Parochial House gets new technology in the form of a tea-making machine. Needless to say, everything turns out for the best...well...sort of.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e986ed7675cfc948f21f30561069bd65080efb94","amp;dn":"Father+Ted+-+A+Christmassy+Ted","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e986ed7675cfc948f21f30561069bd65080efb94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,134,237,118,117,207,201,72,242,31,48,86,16,105,189,101,8,14,251,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
