The band were chart regulars throughout the 1970s and 1980s. The act has at least one hit every year between 1970 and 1984 and &quot;You Sexy Thing&quot; made the Top 10 in three decades. With their seductive lead singer Errol Brown, Hot Chocolate became as entwined with 1970s pop culture as Star Wars. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c13eb7678a0c39d04c6be2433cfccd8f9c3b19b","amp;dn":"Hot+Chocolate-12+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c13eb7678a0c39d04c6be2433cfccd8f9c3b19b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,19,235,118,120,160,195,157,4,198,190,36,51,207,204,216,249,195,177,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
