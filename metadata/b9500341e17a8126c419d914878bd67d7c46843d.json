Into The Blue [1990], 18 hours 15 mins, read by Paul Shelley.\nHarry Barnett is a middle-aged failure, leading a shabby existence in the shadow of a past disgrace, reduced to caretaking a friend's villa on the island of Rhodes and working in a bar to earn his keep. Then a guest at the villa - a young woman he had instantly and innocently warmed to - disappears on a mountain peak. Under suspicion of her murder, Harry stumbles on a set of photographs taken by Heather Mallender in the weeks before her disappearance. Desperately, obsessed by the mystery that has changed his life, he begins to trace back the movements and encounters that led to the moment when she vanished into the blue. The trail leads him back to England, to a world he thought he had left for ever, and at every step of the way a new and baffling light is shed on all the assumptions that have made Harry what he is...\n\n#2. Out Of The Sun [1996], 11 hours 55 mins, read by Paul Shelley.\nWhen Harry Barnett is anonymously informed that his son is languishing in hospital in a diabetic coma, he is certain there must be some mistake, since he does not have a son. But he soon discovers that he does. David Venning is a brilliant mathematician, whose illness is taken to be either a tragic accident or a suicide attempt. But, oddly enough, his notebooks are missing from the hotel room in which he was found. And Harry discovers that two other scientists employed, like David, by Globescope Inc., an American forecasting institute, have died in mysterious circumstances. Perhaps David is actually the victim of attempted murder. And perhaps the deaths of other Globescope staff are not the coincidences they seem. Pursuing the truth in England, Denmark and the United States, Harry finds himself entangled in several different kinds of conspiracy, none of which he should - in theory - be able to defeat. But as before in his life, Harry finds that circumstance and theory are not necessarily the same thing...\n\n#3. Never Go Back [2006], 11 hours 40 mins, read by Joe Dunlop.\nHarry Barnett is leading a contented life in Vancouver with his wife and daughter when he is brought back to England by the death of his mother. He intends to spend just a few days sorting out her affairs when a chance meeting he will regret for the rest of his life makes him change his plans. Two old acquaintances from his National Service days track Harry down to his mother's house - the last address they had for him. A lavish reunion has been organised to mark the fiftieth anniversary of their RAF days. Harry decides to go. During the war Harry and his fellow RAF conscripts spent three months in a Scottish castle where they acted as guinea pigs in a psychological experiment. The reunion is to take place in the same castle. It will be a chance to see friends, settle old scores and lay a few ghosts to rest. The party begins on the train up to Aberdeen, until the apparent suicide of one of their number shatters the holiday atmosphere. Their arrival in Scotland seems under a cloud. And when another comrade dies soon after their arrival, Harry is gripped by a sense of foreboding. The recollections of the old comrades of their time in the castle are frighteningly different and unexplained events from 1955 still haunt them. As Harry tries to solve the mystery of what really happened fifty years ago, he uncovers an extraordinary secret that convinces him he will never leave the castle alive!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9500341e17a8126c419d914878bd67d7c46843d","amp;dn":"The+Harry+Barnett+Mystery+Trilogy+-+Robert+Goddard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9500341e17a8126c419d914878bd67d7c46843d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,80,3,65,225,122,129,38,196,25,217,20,135,139,214,125,124,70,132,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
