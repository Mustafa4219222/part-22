But can water really be magical? \n\nIn the second of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Peter Wothers drinks from \nthe fountain and finds out whether the elements lurking in the water can \nrestore his youth. Along the way he discovers how exploding balloons could \nsolve the energy crisis, how water contains the remains of the most violent \nreactions on Earth and that the real secret to eternal youth might be drinking \nno water at all. \n\nPeter is joined in his quest by Paralympic champion cyclist Mark Colbourne and \nfinds out what happens when the two most reactive elements on the periodic \ntable, caesium and fluorine, meet each other.\n\n-----\nVideo|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........: XVID\t\nCodec Name ........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\t\nBitrate ...........: 1536 \nResolution ........: 624 x 352 \nAspect Ratio ......: 1.773 \nFramerate .........: 25.000 \n\n-----\nAudio|\n-----\n\nCodec Name ........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 \nBitrate ...........: 128 KB/s (CBR) \nChannels ..........: 2 \nSampling Rate .....: 48000 Hz \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23d5b885fd199215634e191370a335aefdbe5c6","amp;dn":"BBC+Royal+Institution+Christmas+Lectures+The+Modern+Alchemist+2+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23d5b885fd199215634e191370a335aefdbe5c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,61,91,136,95,209,153,33,86,52,225,145,55,10,51,90,239,219,229,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
