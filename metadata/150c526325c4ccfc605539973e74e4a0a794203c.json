RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Ubisoft DRM\n              - :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action\n\n\nNote:\n~~~~~\nAgain the SR release comes with a shitty crack. It requires Uplay to even\nwork. For several users, like with their initial release, it doesn't work\nunder any circumstance. If Uplay is uninstalled or updated it will stop\nworking. Even if done by another game. Funny that they claim to &quot;implent&quot;\nand emulate it when that is the case. Just like some of their Steam titles\nthat mysteriously break without the Steam client installed. Only in their\nfantasy land is our release the dupe and theirs the valid one.\n\nEnjoy this proper update.
