These people have slow download and it helps them a lot (please, be generous - on such file having ratio 15:1 is like 1:1 on normal-sized XviD).. \nThank you.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\nQuarks are point particles (no size) unlike protons and neutrons. \nProtons and neutrons are made of quarks. Quarks come in different types. There are six different types: up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom. For example, a proton is comprised of two up quarks and one down quark. Quarks have electric charge, color charge, spin and mass. But they have no internal structure, they behave like mathematical points.\n\nElectrons are members of the lepton family. Like the quarks, leptons are also point particles. \n\n**********************************************************************\n\n\nContent:\n                Size: 44,633,452 bytes (42.566 MB)\n                Play duration: 00:39:55 (2394.62 s)\n                Container type: MP4/MOV\n\n         The.Colbert.Report.2010.04.08.Neil.DeGrasse.Tyson.H264[quark].mp4\n                Size: 24,031,820 bytes (22.919 MB)\n                Play duration: 00:22:22 (1342.298333 s)\n               Container type: MP4/MOV\n\n         The.Daily.Show.2010.04.08.David.Remnick.H264[quark].mp4\n               Size: 24,029,041 bytes (22.916 MB)\n               Play duration: 00:21:30 (1289.543333 s)\n               Container type: MP4/MOV\n\nMajor brand: ISO Base Media version 1\nCompatible brands: JVT AVC\nCreation time: 8/04/2010 09:38:05 UTC\nModification time: 8/04/2010 09:38:05 UTC\nNumber of streams: 2\nType of stream nr. 1: audio (AAC Low complexity) {GPAC ISO Audio Handler}\nType of stream nr. 2: video (avc1) {GPAC ISO Video Handler}\nVideo Codec: avc1\nResolution: 352 x 192\nDisplay aspect ratio: 341:192 = 1.776041 (~16:9)\nFramerate: 29.970029 fps\nBitrate: 131.527908 kbps\nAudio Codec: AAC Low complexity\nBitrate: 16.110460 kbps\nChannels: 1\nSample rate: 11025 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5dbfc458b5c52212c4e74f2257e8931f40e9e5e","amp;dn":"Talk.Shows.Pack.2010.04.08%28Craig.The.Daily.Colbert%29.H264%5Bquark%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5dbfc458b5c52212c4e74f2257e8931f40e9e5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,219,252,69,139,92,82,33,44,78,116,242,37,126,137,49,244,14,158,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
