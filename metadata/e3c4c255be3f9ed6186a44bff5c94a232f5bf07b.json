In it, Bayless channels his anxieties, dreams, and paranoiac tendencies on this 12-track epic, exploring themes of a fractured, disintegrating world, the desire for new beginnings, madness, mania, serenity, and the indelible tenacity and spirit ingrained in humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s collective unconscious.
