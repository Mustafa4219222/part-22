This fine CD finds Foster extending the tradition of Count Basie with new arrangements and features for both veterans (including trumpeter Sonny Cohn, altoist Danny Turner, and the tenors of Kenny Hing and Eric Dixon) and the newer members (such as trumpeter Byron Stripling and pianist Ace Carter). With Carmenproving to be the band's best vocalist since Joe Williams, Frank Foster had succeeded at not only reviving the Count Basie Orchestra but restoring it to its prime. The lengthy &quot;Count Basie Remembrance Suite,&quot; &quot;Booze Brothers&quot; and a new version of Neal Hefti's &quot;Whirly Bird&quot; are among this enjoyable CD's highlights. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Booze Brothers\n02. Katherine The Great\n03. Young And Foolish\n04. Do Nothin' Til' You Hear From Me\n05. Exactly Like You\n06. Papa Foss\n07.
