Released around the holidays of 1983 (Thanksgiving or Christmas??), this album packs a variety of their songs that they recorded with RCA from 1975-1983 (except for one song that came out in 1973, She's Gone, when H&amp;O were at Atlantic). Also, when this album first came out in '83, there were two new songs that H&amp;O had recorded in September of that year for this album's release, Adult Education and Say It Isn't So. I first heard this album years ago as a kid when my mother bought the vinyl (it had this red, yellow, and black cover art), and it was wonderful; Hall &amp; Oates have great voices and their chemistry is splendid. This is my most favorite album of theirs.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
