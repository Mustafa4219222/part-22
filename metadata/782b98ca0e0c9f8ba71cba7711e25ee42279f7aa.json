The project employed intensive archaeological survey and geological investigations to determine patterns of human activity and changes to the landscape, from earliest times through the medieval period. The volume contains an overview of the project, a discussion of the survey methodology employed, the results of a separate Palaeolithic survey and a spatial analysis of the finds at a remarkable Upper Palaeolithic site, and geomorphological studies of both the Ambracian Gulf and the lower Acheron River Valley. The results add to the growing body of survey data from Greece and show the utility of an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the past","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:782b98ca0e0c9f8ba71cba7711e25ee42279f7aa","amp;dn":"Landscape+Archaeology+in+Southern+Epirus%2C+Greece+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"782b98ca0e0c9f8ba71cba7711e25ee42279f7aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,43,152,202,14,12,159,139,167,28,186,119,17,226,94,228,34,121,247,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
