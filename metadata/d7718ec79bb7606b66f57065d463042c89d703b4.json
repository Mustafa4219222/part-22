Well, almost never.\n\nAfter a near-death experience (choking on a hero sandwich), Beth is revived only to realize she now has a direct line to God. Of course, her husband Tom is skeptical and dismissive - and his mistress is all but hostile that her lover's wife is now a prophet! But when inexplicable things begin to happen, everyone's beliefs are tested. Beth starts to say and do things that shock her family and entrance her friends, but she isn't going to be your typical &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; prophet. Let's just say if God had a desperate housewife as His mouthpiece, Beth would be it! She is the absolute last person on Earth who would be chosen. Then again, they say He works in mysterious ways. And this one is a real mystery!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7718ec79bb7606b66f57065d463042c89d703b4","amp;dn":"Save.Me.S01E05.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7718ec79bb7606b66f57065d463042c89d703b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,113,142,199,155,183,96,107,102,245,112,101,212,99,4,44,137,215,3,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
