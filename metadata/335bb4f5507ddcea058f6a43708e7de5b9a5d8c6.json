Written by Jeffrey Farnol; Full-cast dramatisation starring Steven Pacey, Sean Barrett, Sean Arnold, Julia Swift and Ronald Herdman; Dramatised by Michael Bartlett.\n\nMartin Conisby, embittered by his five years of slavery on the Spanish galleon Esmeralda, escapes during a sea fight and makes his way back to England, determined to avenge himself on Richard Brandon, who was the cause of his father's death and his own ill-treatment. Broken in body and spirit, he arrives home just in time to save from the hands of robbers a beautiful girl, Lady Joan Brandon, the daughter of the man whom he has sworn to punish. In a tavern he meets a pal, Adam Penfeather, who unfolds to him the story of Black Bartlemy, an infamous pirate, and his treasure buried on an island--treasure of fabuous value that has been the dream and hope of roving adventurers along the Spanish Main for many years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:335bb4f5507ddcea058f6a43708e7de5b9a5d8c6","amp;dn":"Jeffrey+Farnol+-+Black+Bartlemy%27s+Treasure+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"335bb4f5507ddcea058f6a43708e7de5b9a5d8c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,91,180,245,80,125,220,234,5,143,106,67,112,142,125,229,185,165,216,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
