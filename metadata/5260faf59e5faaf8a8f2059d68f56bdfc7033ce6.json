Hope it suits everyone.  Please let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.\n\nSince this is a live album, I didn't split up the tracks, but a cue file is included.  Very thin on the artwork; no access to a scanner.  Sorry about that.\n\nEAC log file shows album not in AccurateRip database, but it is a genuine copy!  I bought it from the store myself!\n\nOne of the best live albums from the 70s.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5260faf59e5faaf8a8f2059d68f56bdfc7033ce6","amp;dn":"UFO+-+Strangers+in+the+Night+%28live%2C+1979%29+%28FLAC%29+BLORRY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5260faf59e5faaf8a8f2059d68f56bdfc7033ce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,96,250,245,158,95,170,248,168,242,5,157,104,245,107,223,199,3,60,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
