T.C. Jeffords (Huston) is a cunning and highly successful ranch owner who has announced his engagement to a wealthy socialite, Flo Burnett (Judith Anderson). This news is not warmly received by his daughter Vance (Stanwyck); she had a romance of her own with gambler Rip Darrow (Wendell Corey) foiled by her father, and Vance does not care for her light-headed stepmother-to-be. Vance is driven into a violent rage by T.C.'s Machiavellian actions, and when he kills a good friend of Vance's (a ranch hand he believes was helping Mexicans squat on his land), she swears revenge on her father and joins forces with Darrow to see that violent justice is done. The Furies proved to be Walter Huston's last film; he died within a few months of its release.\r\n\r\nSource\tDVD\r\nRip Specs\tFile Name .........................................: The.Furies.1950.DVDRip.Xvid.avi\r\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,472,399,360 bytes\r\nRuntime ............................................: 1:49:13\r\n\r\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\r\nFrame Size ......................................: 544x400 (AR: 1.360)\r\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\r\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1495 kb/s\r\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.287 bpp\r\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\r\n\r\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\r\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 160 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\r\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\r\n\r\nAudio commentary featuring film historian Jim Kitses (Horizons West)\r\n\r\nKG by davev205.
