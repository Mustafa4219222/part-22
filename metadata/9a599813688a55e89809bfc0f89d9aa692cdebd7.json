He is probably best-known for the 1979 hit song&quot;Is She\nReally Going Out with Him?\\&quot;, which still gets extensive FM radio airplay; for his 1982 hit,\n\\&quot;Steppin\\' Out\\&quot;; and for his 1984 success with \\&quot;You Can\\'t Get What You Want\n[Till You Know What You Want]\\&quot;.\n\nAlong with Elvis Costello and Graham Parker, Jackson was a part of the trio of English artists\nwho challenged the punk scene and brought a New Wave sound to the United States[citation\nneeded] in the late 1970s. He was popular for his pop/rock and new wave music early on\nbefore moving to more eclectic, though less commercially successful, pop/jazz/classical\nhybrids.\n\n\n  01 - Is She Really Going Out With Him?
