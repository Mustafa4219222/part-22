'Paranoid' not only changed the face of rock music forever but also defined the sound and style of heavy metal more than any other record in rock history. The result of a magic chemistry between four Rnglish musicians, it catapulted Black Sabbath into the rock strtosphere.\nThis programme tells the story behind the writing, recording and success of this groundbreaking album. Using exclusive interviews, musical demonstrations, archive footage and returning to the multi-tracks with engineer Tom Allom, the film reveals how Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward created their frighteningly dark, heavy and ear-shattering loud sound.\nThe multi-platinum selling 'Paranoid' is arguably Black Sabbath's finest albums, not to mention one of the most seminal heavy metal albums of all time, containing some of the band's best-known signature songs, including the title track 'Paranoid', 'Iron man', 'Hand of doom' and 'War pigs'. This is truly a classic album.\n\nSCENE SELECTION\n\nEarly Sabbath\nWar pigs\nIron man\nPlanet caravan\nElectric funeral\nHand of doom\nFairies wear boots\nParanoid\n\nBONUS MATERIAL: Contains over 42 minutes of additional material not included in the TV Broadcast.\n\nMusical influences\n1st US Tour\nNo returns\nPlay in a day the Iommi way\nDid give up the day job\nParanoid\nGeezer's bargain bassment\nRat salad\nBillie's traps\nPlanet caravan\nThe backing track tapes\n\nDVD 5\n16:9\nDoby digital 2.0 Stereo\nNTSC\nRegion code : 0\nEnglish\nE-exempt from classification\nSubtitles : English, Deutsch, EspaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ol, FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais, Italiano, Nederlands, PortuguÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s\n97 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4222acd5ec2681ee32ac61f7b48f341daef270f8","amp;dn":"BLACK+SABBATH+%5C%27PARANOID%5C%27+CLASSIC+ALBUMS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4222acd5ec2681ee32ac61f7b48f341daef270f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,34,172,213,236,38,129,238,50,172,97,247,180,143,52,29,174,242,112,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
