Following an introduction, the text goes on to treat synthesis, characterization techniques, thermal, optical, magnetic and electronic properties, processing and, finally, emerging applications.\r\n\r\nA sound overview of the &quot;nano world&quot; from an applicationâ€“oriented perspective.\r\n\r\nReviews for the first edition:\r\n\r\n&quot;The reader [of this book] profits from the broad scientific teaching experience of the author.... This book is highly recommended for everyone who wants to step onto the new and fascinating field of nanomaterials.&quot; (International Journal of Materials Research, May 2009)\r\n\r\n&quot;The practical presentation and clarity in writing style makes this book a winner for anyone wanting to quickly learn about the fundamentals and practical side of nanomaterials.&quot; (IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine, March/April 2009)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:564da261a9ace02bfef843c379bb8dac81d8724c","amp;dn":"Nanomaterials+-+An+Introduction+to+Synthesis%2C+Properties+and+App","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"564da261a9ace02bfef843c379bb8dac81d8724c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,77,162,97,169,172,224,43,254,248,67,195,121,187,141,172,129,216,114,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
