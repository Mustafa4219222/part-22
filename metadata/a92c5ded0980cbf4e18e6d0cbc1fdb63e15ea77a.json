Not very surprising, having been made the same year. The Nyman soundtrack gives this less fictional documentary quite a nice backbone.\n\nNot that being struck by lightning makes for a guaranteed good story, but Greenaway shows he is quite adept at coaxing quite a few out of a thematic approach to documentary filmmaking. As if there was any doubt there. \n\nChopping off the other 6 gigs of dead weight denies you the chance to judge for yourself just how badly others fare in attempting the same coaxing. You'll just have to trust me on this one.\n\nSo, shoot me...\n\nUncompressed, but diddled with, NTSC VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a92c5ded0980cbf4e18e6d0cbc1fdb63e15ea77a","amp;dn":"Peter+Greenaway+-+Michael+Nyman+-+Act+of+God+%281980%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a92c5ded0980cbf4e18e6d0cbc1fdb63e15ea77a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,44,93,237,9,128,203,244,225,142,109,12,188,31,219,99,225,94,167,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
