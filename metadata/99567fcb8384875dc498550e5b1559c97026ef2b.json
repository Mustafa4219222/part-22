He starts by uncovering how terriers have become an important ally in New York's long running war of Man versus Rat. Larry then sees how the best place to live the good Russian life is in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach neighborhood. He then takes up two sports that NYC does better than anywhere else. First he brings his basketball skills to Harlem's Rucker Park, the legendary sanctuary of &quot;street ball.&quot; Finally, Larry finds himself in the middle of a classic bar fight at a very macho hardcore arm wrestling competition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99567fcb8384875dc498550e5b1559c97026ef2b","amp;dn":"Only+in+America+with+Larry+the+Cable+Guy+S03E15+-+Larry+Gets+Whi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99567fcb8384875dc498550e5b1559c97026ef2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,86,127,203,131,132,135,93,196,152,85,14,91,21,89,201,112,38,239,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
