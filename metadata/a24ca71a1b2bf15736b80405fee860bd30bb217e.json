Having a boyfriend\nwas practically impossible until she met a guy that wasn't\nafraid to stand up to them - Dominic. He was sweet,\nthoughtful, and everything MacKenzie ever wanted in a man.\n\nBut when they go away to college at Old Dominion University,\nMacKenzie sees a whole new side of Dominic and begins to\nwonder if he really is different from every other guy. Her\nworld is turned upside down after a party, and her brothers'\nbest friend Hunter is the one there to offer her a shoulder\nto cry on. The chemistry between them is electric, and\nfeelings for each other that have been hidden for years are\nfinally voiced. Is Hunter willing to be disloyal to his best\nfriends in order to be with the one girl\nhe's always secretly wanted?\n\n\nTrying Not To Love You (Love #1)\nby Megan Smith\nLanguage: EN\nPages: EPUB 424","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a24ca71a1b2bf15736b80405fee860bd30bb217e","amp;dn":"Trying+Not+To+Love+You+%28Love+%231%29+by+Megan+Smith++EPUB+EN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a24ca71a1b2bf15736b80405fee860bd30bb217e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,76,167,26,27,43,241,87,54,184,4,5,254,232,96,189,48,187,33,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
