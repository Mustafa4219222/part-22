One of the CD&amp;#039;s finest attributes is the excellent song selection. The Peggy Lee classic &quot;Fever&quot; is tastefully covered here, and Sample&amp;#039;s own &quot;Street Life&quot; is reprised again, but the remainder of the program is new, at least to my ears. Most of the tunes establish an emotional connection with the listener; they&amp;#039;re beautiful, pensive, soulful, and often introspective. Titles such as &quot;Living in Blue,&quot; &quot;When Your Life Was Low,&quot; &quot;When the World Turns Blue,&quot; and &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; convey this theme. Vocalist Lalah Hathaway delivers heartfelt, expressive interpretations on over half of the program. She is a talent I&amp;#039;m looking forward to hearing more of in the future. Joe Sample, as usual, shines on piano with thoughtful, expressive, and sometimes understated solos.\nPersonnel:\n\nJoe Sample - piano\nLalah Hathaway - vocals\nKirk Whalum - sax\nDavid Delhomme - synthesizers\nMichael Thompson - electric guitar\nJay Anderson - bass\nWalfredo Reyes Jr. - drums\nLenny Castro - percussion\n\nTrack Listings:\n1.
