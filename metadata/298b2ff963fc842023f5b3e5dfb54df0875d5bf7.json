Never Never Land (03:52)\n\nWhen Robbie Boyd gets it right his music is like a Wes Andersen Film where he paints picture-perfect images with his quirky personality and charming lyrics. The new album Ã¢â‚¬Å“So Called ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, however, will divide opinion with its combination of tracks from previous EPs and new material. Listen once, twice, ten times to this album and you will not always be sure where he is quite going with it. \n\nThe first two tracks Ã¢â‚¬Å“OrionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s BeltÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let You GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have sunshine written all over them. Picture summer fields, running through make believe corn and travelling around in a camper van with your mates during the holidays. With all the feel good vibes of the first half of the album, he probably should have been paid to do a soundtrack for all those summer holiday adverts in January. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Let You GoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ comes from one of Robbie's early EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprising that it made the final cut. This track live is always a crowd pleaser - he recently supported Brother and Bones at Scala and the crowd were buzzing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:298b2ff963fc842023f5b3e5dfb54df0875d5bf7","amp;dn":"Robbie+Boyd+-+So+Called+Man+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"298b2ff963fc842023f5b3e5dfb54df0875d5bf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,139,47,249,99,252,132,32,35,245,179,229,223,181,77,240,135,93,91,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
