Upon first viewing the trailer, I thought we would have another Kung Pow: Enter The Fist on our hands but, boy, was I wrong. Unlike Kung Pow, the jokes did not grow tired on me and the special effects were definitely top notch. The scene with the two assassins playing that stringed instrument (don&amp;#039;t know the name of it) in such a way that it kills was incredible.\n\nAlthough there was not much to the story, it was not non-existent, either. There was a simple story happening which made sense for what we were watching. Even the jokes with the subtitles came across as funny, and from my experience, humor does not translate as easily as this movie would have you believe. It borrowed or spoofed a bit from Spider-Man and The Matrix as well, which was a bit unexpected for this film, initially. At least for me.\n\nTo be honest, I could enjoy this movie without sound or subtitles, too. It was that appealing to the eye. It would be a good background movie for a party or poker game which could catch your eye at any moment and still hold your attention. It could also be great if you feel like a good comedy. I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater, it held my interest all the way to the end. 9/10 \n\n\navi info:\n\ndisplay preferences:\nw:640pix\nh:256pix\n\naudio preferences:\nlengh: 1:39:25\nbit rate: 129kb/s\nencoder: MPEG Layer-3\n\nvideo preferences:\n23cps\ntransfer rate: 120kb/s\nsample rate: 12 bit\nvideo coder: Xvid codec\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa9d7342a4eb1d33cbe12cf11ffb3e593a8d018a","amp;dn":"Kung+fu+Hustle+%282004%29+aka+Kung+Fu+Szal+aka+Hong+Kong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa9d7342a4eb1d33cbe12cf11ffb3e593a8d018a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,157,115,66,164,235,29,51,203,225,44,241,31,251,62,89,58,141,1,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
