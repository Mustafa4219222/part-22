But the result is often just the opposite for discriminating listeners: after so many of these artists milk the treacle machine, nobody sounds genuine anymore and that rarefied Christmas sentiment is buried beneath layers and layers of pretty paper. That said, A Country Superstar Christmas III, featuring veterans such as Alan Jackson, George Strait, Alabama, and Reba McEntire along with up-and-comers such as Alecia Elliott, Chely Wright, and Mark Wills, fares pretty well. Toby Keith's &quot;Christmas Rock&quot; has some funny twists on an old rite, George Strait takes a new look at &quot;Christmas Cookies,&quot; and only Vince Gill seems really lost in the reverence realm with a very stately reading of &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful.&quot; A pleasant mainstream collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:112cada580b0248568413194c7b4cb74835cb72d","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+A+Country+Superstar+Christmas%2C+Vol.+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"112cada580b0248568413194c7b4cb74835cb72d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,44,173,165,128,176,36,133,104,65,49,148,199,180,203,116,131,92,183,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
