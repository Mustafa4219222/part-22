Then print the DVD Cover and DVD Inlay Booklet (oh yes\nyou get this too).\n\nI noticed that some of the colour versions are slightly shorter\nthan the B&amp;W versions.  In Brats, for example, you'll see that\nsome small scenes were cut out of the colour version and so is\nshorter than the restored B&amp;W version.  Brats is on DVD Vol 5.\nNote that colourised versions are not as sharp as the B&amp;W versions,\nalthough this is normal if you've ever seen a L&amp;H colourised\nversion before.\n\n\nIncase you missed it, here's the URLs to all torrents done so far...\n\nDVD Vol 1:\thttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3427416\nDVD Vol 2:\thttp://thepiratebay.se/details.php?id=3431935\n\n\nEstimated arrival of Vol 4:    1st or 2nd week Feb 06\n\nNote my upload speed is crap, initial seeing will take 5 days,\nif you want a faster download wait until there are more seeds!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:233ff8be4e8be7ca4130fae5e70f73df643b849d","amp;dn":"Laurel+and+Hardy+DVD+Vol+3+%28of+21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"233ff8be4e8be7ca4130fae5e70f73df643b849d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,63,248,190,78,139,231,202,65,48,250,229,231,15,115,223,100,59,132,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
