Brett\nArtist:  Jack Jadson\nColors by Marcelo Pinto\nLetters by Simon Bowland\nCover Artist:  Mel Rubi\n\nPicking up where Peter V. Brett's Red Sonja: Blue one-shot left off, with Sonja fleeing the scene of a murder after killing a young man who tried to test her vow. Bereft of her signature chain-mail and the reputation that goes with it, she must rely on her wits and her sword as she embarks on a new series of adventures. Guilt-ridden, penniless and on the run, she is unaware that the innocent blood she spilled has awakened the dark spirit of the demon whose pelt she wears.\n\nThanks goes to Re-em for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3100931f02e5da558cccfc0776295e5011bca6f","amp;dn":"Red+Sonja+Unchained+1+%282013%29+%28c2c%29+%28Re-em-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3100931f02e5da558cccfc0776295e5011bca6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,16,9,49,240,46,93,165,88,204,207,192,119,98,149,229,1,27,202,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
