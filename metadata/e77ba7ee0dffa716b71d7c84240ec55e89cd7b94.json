Starting out in the late '80s as a club DJ, the former Alexander Coe got his first big break\r\nwhen he was hired by the dance club Shelly's to spin and rework popular sounds of the day. It was there\r\nthat the young DJ found fame with the dance and house crowd, but it wasn't until he started laying down\r\nhis grooves at the HaÃ§ienda and Renaissance that he become known nationally and, eventually, globally.\r\nHis sound and technique become so popular that a Renaissance compilation was released, one of the\r\nvery first DJ mix albums to ever hit the record stores.\r\n\r\nIt was while still at Renaissance that Sasha met another DJ, John Digweed. The two became a remixing\r\nteam and soon released the first volume of their Northern Exposure series (a mix album that also functioned\r\nas a collection of the duo's remixes for others). The duo toured behind the release, visiting the U.S., Australia,\r\nSouth Africa, and Southeast Asia. Sasha refused to limit himself to DJ work, however; he collaborated with\r\nsinger Maria Naylor on the Top 20 hit &quot;Be as One,&quot; and remixed tracks from such popular artists as the\r\nPet Shop Boys, Simply Red, and M People. He also formed his own record company, Excession Recordings,\r\nand wrote originals for Deconstruction.\r\n\r\nIn late 1997, another Sasha + John Digweed compilation appeared, Northern Exposure, Vol. 2, available in\r\nboth East Coast and West Coast versions (each contained completely different songs). He's released several\r\nmix albums on his own as well, including multiple volumes in the Global Underground series (San Francisco\r\nand Ibiza). A rare production release, the Xpander EP, became a dancefloor hit in 1999. The mix album\r\nCommunicate followed a year later, and in 2002, he scored an American record deal with Kinetic and released\r\nhis first production full-length, Airdrawndagger. His next major record project, Involver, was a fusion of mix album\r\nand production record, consisting of his own exclusive remixes of tracks from UNKLE, Felix da Housecat,\r\nand Ulrich Schnauss, among others.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio Information, Torrent File Contents And Specifications\r\n\r\nArtist / Group: Sasha\r\nGenre: Electronic / Dance / Progressive House / Progressive Trance / Breaks / Break Beat\r\nAlbums Release Years: 2004\r\nNumber of CD's: 1\r\nNumber of Tracks: 10\r\nLabel: Global Underground Ltd\r\nCatalog: GUSA001CDX\r\nTotal Playing Time: 1 Hours, 17 Minutes and 43 Seconds (77 Minutes)\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\r\nCodec Version: reference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\r\nEncoding Bit Rate (Average): 958 kbps\r\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Normal Stereo)\r\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio Files Source: Original Compact Disc's\r\nConverter / Encoder (From CD): EAC V1.1\r\n________________________________\r\n\r\nAudio File ID Tag Format: VorbisComment\r\nTag Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\r\nImage Files: Front and Back Album Covers (embedded artwork within audio files)\r\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE, MD5, FFP, M3U, foo dr and Track List\r\nTotal File Size: 539 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e77ba7ee0dffa716b71d7c84240ec55e89cd7b94","amp;dn":"Sasha+-+Involver+%5B2004%5D+%5BFLAC+-+EAC%5D+BSW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e77ba7ee0dffa716b71d7c84240ec55e89cd7b94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,123,167,238,13,255,167,22,183,29,124,132,36,14,197,94,137,205,123,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
