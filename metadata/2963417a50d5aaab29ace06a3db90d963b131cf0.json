During the second half of the sixteenth century the observations of Tycho Brahe furnished the material from which Kepler derived the accurate space-time description of the planetary motion contained in his three laws. (The first two were published in 1609, the third in 1619.)\n1. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the Sun at the focus.\n2. The line joining planet and Sun sweeps over equal areas in equal intervals of time.\n3. The ratio of the cube of the mean distance from the Sun to the square of the period is the same for all planets.\nKepler&amp;#039;s three laws contain a clear and complete statement of the actual state of motion of the planets. Nothing is missing in these three laws and nothing need be subtracted. We must not forget that Kepler&amp;#039;s laws were derived after an exhaustive analysis of material obtained without telescopes; none of the early instruments used for measuring directions to objects was equiped with lenses. Kepler was unaware of the existence of double stars; and, as a matter of fact, their elliptical state of motion was unknown until the nineteenth century. The unraveling of the observations and the recognition of the surveyed oval orbits of the planets as ellipses ranks as one of the greatest discoveries ever made. The signifiance of Kepler&amp;#039;s laws cannot be overestimated; they are the clue to the universal law of gravitation.\n(from BASIC ASTRONOMY, Peter Van De Kamp, Random House, USA, 1952) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2963417a50d5aaab29ace06a3db90d963b131cf0","amp;dn":"Kepler%5C%27s+Laws+Of+Planetary+Motion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2963417a50d5aaab29ace06a3db90d963b131cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,99,65,122,80,213,170,171,41,172,224,106,61,185,13,150,59,19,28,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
