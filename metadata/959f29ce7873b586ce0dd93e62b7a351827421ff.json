Using a dialectical view of the development of thought in the discipline, Gerhard Lenski describes the outlines of an emerging synthesis of theories. He shows that perspectives as diverse and contradictory as those of Marx, Spencer, Sumner, Veblen, Mosca, Pareto, Sorokin, Parsons, and Dahrendorf are parts of an evolving and systematic body of theory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:959f29ce7873b586ce0dd93e62b7a351827421ff","amp;dn":"Power+%26amp%3B+Privilege+-+Gerhard+E.+Lenski+%28epub%2C+mobi%2C+pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"959f29ce7873b586ce0dd93e62b7a351827421ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,159,41,206,120,115,181,134,206,13,217,62,98,183,163,81,130,116,33,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
