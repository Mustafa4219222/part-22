The people on a Norfolk farm, in a Yorkshire mill, a Welsh iron foundry, an Irish village, a London bank, a Scottish mountain? The aristocrats and paupers, old and young, butchers and bakers and candlestick makersÃ¢â‚¬â€how did the war touch their lives?\nJenny Uglow follows the gripping back-and-forth of the first global war but turns the news upside down, seeing how it reached the people. Illustrated by the satires of Gillray and Rowlandson and the paintings of Turner and Constable, and combining the familiar voices of Austen, Wordsworth, Scott, and Byron with others lost in the crowd, In These Times delves into the archives to tell the moving story of how people lived and loved and sang and wrote, struggling through hard times and opening new horizons that would change their country for a century.\n\nAbout the Author\nJenny UglowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s books include prizewinning biographies of Elizabeth Gaskell and William Hogarth. The Lunar Men (FSG, 2002) was described by Richard Holmes as Ã¢â‚¬Å“an extraordinarily gripping account,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ while NatureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Engraver won the National Arts Writers Award for 2007. A Gambling Man (FSG, 2009) was short-listed for the 2010 Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction. Uglow grew up in Cumbria and now lives in Canterbury, England.\n\nCONTENTS\nTitle Page\nCopyright Notice\nDedication\nMap  \nI : STIRRING, 1789Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1792  \nII : ARMING, 1793Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1796 \nIII : WATCHING, 1797Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1801\nIV : PAUSING, 1801Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1803\nV : SAILING, 1803Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1808\nVI : FIGHTING, 1809Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1815\nVII : ENDINGS, 1815 and beyond\nAcknowledgements\nPrincipal events of the wars\nSources and abbreviations\nSelect bibliography\nNotes\nIndex\nList of Illustrations\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/e4voe637r/In_These_Times.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s13.postimg.org/e4voe637r/In_These_Times.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04603162884ffe29dcfb5ed18602b63ec9e77cad","amp;dn":"In+These+Times+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04603162884ffe29dcfb5ed18602b63ec9e77cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,96,49,98,136,79,254,41,220,251,94,209,134,2,182,62,201,231,124,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
