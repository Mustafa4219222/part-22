It's a   :\n : remarkably prevalent method of exposure featured by graffiti artists       :\n : worldwide. These labels are free, portable, and quick and easy to exhibit, :\n : offering artists the chance to spend more time creating their work than if :\n : they were to paint and write directly on walls, vehicles, and public       :\n : objects.                                                                   :\n : camden noir launched his Label 228 project by putting out a call to        :\n : artists, asking them to send him their artwork or anything, for that       :\n : matter, on priority mail labels. Within six months, he received over 500   :\n : labels from artists all over the world. At this point, he has over 1,500   :\n : labels from over 600 artists. This is a collection of the best of those    :\n : labels, in a beautiful, full-color book.                                   :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91d2c7f9e7d9c6c0bbaf31e54ad39b60c644d964","amp;dn":"Soft+Skull+Press+Label+228-A+Street+Art+Project+2012+Retail+eBoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91d2c7f9e7d9c6c0bbaf31e54ad39b60c644d964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,210,199,249,231,217,198,192,187,175,49,229,74,211,155,96,198,68,217,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
