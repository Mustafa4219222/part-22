OMD were originally assimilated in the greater new wave batch of synthesiser-based acts of the later 1970sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“early 1980s.[1]\n\nThe group was founded in 1978 by Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys who remained, and were perceived as, the core members. Adding sidemen Malcolm Holmes and Martin Cooper by the end of 1980, this quartet (with occasional line-up fluctuations) was the live concert line-up until 1989, when Humphreys, Cooper and Holmes all left OMD to found The Listening Pool. McCluskey then retained the OMD name and continued to record and tour as OMD with new line-ups through 1996.\n\nAlthough McCluskey essentially retired the OMD name in 1996, shortly thereafter Humphreys began playing live shows as OMD with other musicians on an as-needed basis, but without McCluskey. Then in late December 2005, OMD's official website announced a forthcoming reformation of the &quot;classic&quot; 1980's line-up (Humpheys/McCluskey/Cooper/Holmes), both for live performances and for a new studio album. This reformed quartet began touring in 2007, and further successful sold-out tours took place in 2008 and 2009. OMD's most recent studio album History of Modern was released on 20 September 2010. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Singles 1998\n\n\nThe OMD Singles is a singles compilation album by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, released in 1998. It reached #16 in the UK charts. Originally, the compilation was to include a second disc of new remixes; however, this idea was abandoned due to budget limitations. The few remixes that were produced were released separately as The OMD Remixes. In 2003, The OMD Singles was reissued in France with the remix disc finally included, comprising the 1998 remixes as well as additional remixes.\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Electricity&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n2.\t&quot;Messages&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n3.\t&quot;Enola Gay&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n4.\t&quot;Souvenir&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n5.\t&quot;Joan of Arc&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n6.\t&quot;Maid of Orleans&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:12\n7.\t&quot;Tesla Girls&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:34\n8.\t&quot;Locomotion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n9.\t&quot;Talking Loud and Clear&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n10.\t&quot;So in Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n11.\t&quot;If You Leave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n12.\t&quot;(Forever) Live and Die&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n13.\t&quot;Dreaming&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:58\n14.\t&quot;Sailing on the Seven Seas&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n15.\t&quot;Pandora's Box&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n16.\t&quot;Call My Name&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n17.\t&quot;Dream of Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n18.\t&quot;Walking on the Milky Way&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:693ef5b2c4cd9812b76181ea28c12e096e14d4d0","amp;dn":"O.M.D.+-+The+Singles+%28Greatest+Hits%29+1998+%5BFLAC%5D++-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"693ef5b2c4cd9812b76181ea28c12e096e14d4d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,62,245,178,196,205,152,18,183,97,129,234,40,193,46,9,110,20,212,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
