We know immeasurably more about what's beyond our atmosphere than we did a century ago. We know far, far more than we knew even a decade ago.\n\nIn this epic documentary miniseries, THE UNIVERSE takes you to the leading edge of our ever-expanding astronomical knowledge. A virtual collision of astronomy and history, these ten dense, enlightening hours (14 episodes total) of unprecedented programming give unique insight - through recreations and animations - on the great &quot;Eureka!&quot; moments of celestial understanding and into the very latest celestial discoveries.\n\nAnd with these strikingly realistic computer reconstructions, you'll travel to the outer edges of the Known. Tour THE UNIVERSE! Experience the Cosmos as no-one ever has - not peering at dots through a telescope or scanning pages of numbers - but firsthand. Flirt with a black hole's Event Horizon, rove the surface of Mars, plunge into the Sun.\n\nFurther, this series gives serious, constructive consideration to the great human questions: Are we alone? Is Planet Earth as insignificant to the Cosmos as a drop of water? Is there anywhere else out there that that can support life? Or, is there truly no place like home?\n\nWith 125 billion galaxies in THE UNIVERSE (containing as many as 100 billion stars each!), there's a lot of ground to cover. You'd better start watching now! \n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Erik Thompson\n--------------------------\n\nWritten &amp; Produced by: Andrew Holland\n-------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[HDTV:]\n\n\n\nTitle: The Universe-Season I [14 Episodes]\nYear: 2007\nFile Size: 349 MB &lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt; 350 MB   ----------------&gt;&gt;&gt;[5.12 GB All Episodes]\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:43:58 &lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt; 00:44:37\nVideo Codec: XviD \nVideo Resolution: 576x320\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1068 kbit/s &lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬&gt;&gt; 1084 kbits \nFPS:  23.976000\nAudio Bitrate: 146 kbit/s &lt;&lt;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â€šÂ¬ &gt;&gt;  179 kbits\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3 \nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (N/A\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1051155/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\n\n  EPISODES SEASON I:\n -------------------\n\n\n 1) Secrets Of The Sun   \n 2) Mars The Red Planet     \n 3) End Of The Earth  \n 4) Jupiter The Giant Planet  \n 5) The Moon\n 6) Spaceship Earth \n 7) Mercury &amp; Venus The Inner Planets  \n 8) Saturn Lord of the Rings     \n 9) Alien Galaxies\n10) Life And Death Of A Star\n11) The Outer Planets \n12) Most Dangerous Places  \n13) Search For E.T.\n14) Beyond The Big Bang   (SPECIAL: This Episode Is [699 MB] &amp; 01:30:03 Long)\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view change the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤                                                                                 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤ SPECIAL NOTE: After alot of request i decided to upload Season 1 &amp; 2.I will     Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤               start with season 1.As soon i have decent seeders and leechers    Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤               season 2 will be uploaded as well.
