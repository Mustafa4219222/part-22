We have chosen to focus on the following albums: The Blue Soulution (1990), Watch Your Step (1991), Permanently Blue (1995), Steppin Out Alive (1996) &amp; Blues From Within (1999). Included are also two previously unreleased studio tracks: One day at a time &amp; You know my love and the beautifully haunting track from the Fjellis FjellstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m tribute album Till &amp; frÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥n en blÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ man, the gospel-like Living on borrowed time.\n\nThe opening track says it all, even when his nerves gone bad, Sven Zetterberg is no accidential tourist in the land of soul music, nor is he the kind of guy who carefully pokes his head through the doorway of some jam-packed juke joint in hopes of finding a vacant bar stool. Sven Zetterberg is a musician so completely at home in soul country, he may rightfully be called Swedens foremost soul artist. The material selected here displays a merciless competency, deep soul ballads with a crushing power backed solidly up by guitar solos approaching masochism. Like a slap in the face that does more good than harm, this is healing, this is voodoo for the broken heart. This is the way forward.\n\nThe battle wounds may be fresh, but the voice bears witness to a spirit that is totally undaunted. \n\nLet this compilation serve as a testimony to the simple truth that soul music has no particular nationality or skin color, but finds its source in a universal place, the human heart - whose reckless fondness for saying yes instead of no contains the seeds of sin as well as the powers of redemption. \n\nSoul music for the wild at heart  \n\n(Liner notes by Liza Cantor-Grase)\n\n- - -\n\nSven Zetterberg - Soul of a Man 1990-1999\n(Stockholm Amigo 2004)\n\n 1.
