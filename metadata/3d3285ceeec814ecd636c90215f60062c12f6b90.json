Staples, singer of Tindersticks.\n\n\n56 kbps VBR, ripped from the website (www.stuartastaples.com), after some html analysis. I was surprised the kbps was so low, the sound is very good, and I am picky with soud quality.\n\n!! No complaining about the quality here, I didnt find these elsewhere !!\n\nEnjoy these fine songs, and help others to enjoy: seed more than you want to!\n\nThere are two torrents with the first album as retail, but no seeders there...\n\nMeanwhile listen to this and please share anything retail-like!\n__________\n\nCONTENTS :\n__________\n\n\n- Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04:\n\n01.
