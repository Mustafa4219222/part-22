This section provides you with the essential information you need to get started. You'll be introduced to The Drumming TreeÃ¢â€žÂ¢ and get detailed advice on: setting up your drum set, holding the drumsticks, developing proper posture, basic bass drum technique, accepting the sticks rebound, note values, and rest values. With those essentials down, you'll learn your first drum beats and drum fills.\n\nWhether you are a complete beginner or an experienced drummer, it's strongly recommended that you start with the lessons in this section before moving on. The advice is critical for beginners and it also serves as an important review for more experienced drummers. Future sections will build upon concepts introduced here, so it's in your best interest to start from the beginning.\n\nThe Techniques\n\nOnce you have established a solid foundation, it's time to learn ten essential techniques that will allow you to unlock your full potential on the drum set. The step-by-step lessons in this section will show you how to play ghost notes, use cross-sticking, play rim shots, incorporate dynamics, use a metronome, develop the heel-toe technique, use proper cymbal technique, develop finger control, use the moeller method, and apply essential drum rudiments.\n\nEvery step you take moves you further along your drumming journey - and each lesson gets progressively more enjoyable as we shift our focus from theory to actually applying the concepts and techniques we've been working on. That's the payoff. It's fun to learn new things, but the real enjoyment results from being able to apply what you've learned!\n\nThe Grooves\n\nOnce you have a firm grasp on foundational concepts and essential techniques, it's time to apply what you've learned. In this section you'll make use of The Easy Beat SystemÃ¢â€žÂ¢ and The Drum Fill BuilderÃ¢â€žÂ¢ to unlock your creativity when it comes to writing original beats and fills.\n\nYou'll also get a chance to use The Style SelectorÃ¢â€žÂ¢ to explore a variety of exciting musical genres, including rock, jazz, Latin, funk, heavy metal, punk, blues, reggae, country, and progressive rock. Think of this as an opportunity to 'taste test' different styles. You can then take those that appeal to you, borrow some of the core ideas, and return to The Easy Beat SystemÃ¢â€žÂ¢ and The Drum Fill BuilderÃ¢â€žÂ¢ to come up with original patterns!\n\nThe Breakdown\n\nPlaying the drums is all about creating music and jamming with other musicians. In this section, you'll discover three valuable tools that simplify the way you learn and understand music. These tools are ideal for drummers who are interested in playing live gigs, doing studio work, jamming with musicians, playing in a church, learning cover songs, or creating original music.\n\nYou'll first be introduced to The Drumming Cheat SheetÃ¢â€žÂ¢ which simplifies the process of learning the form of a song. Then you'll get a chance to use The Drumming Song SimplifierÃ¢â€žÂ¢ to quickly and easily learn the parts of your favorite songs. And finally, you'll discover The Note Value Recognition SystemÃ¢â€žÂ¢ which makes it easy to identify the feel of a song in just four to eight bars. Each tool is helpful on its own, but the real advantage comes when you combine them.\n\nThe Bassist\n\nWhen it comes to playing drums along with music, it's critical for drummers to work well with other members of the band. It doesn't matter if we are performing live, recording separately in a studio, or even jamming along with a play-along song - we need to appreciate and understand how to play in relation to what other band members are doing. The most important relationship is with the bassist and what they are playing.\n\nIn this section you will be introduced to The Locked In SystemÃ¢â€žÂ¢. It includes three important phases to consider when 'locking-in' with a bassist. Reviewing these ideas will help you create a solid foundation to make the band sound and perform better as a team.\n\nThe Band\n\nFor many drummers, the ultimate goal is to create original music with a band. However, the process of writing and collaborating on original ideas isn't always easy. With that in mind, this section provides a unique opportunity to witness the creation of five original songs. You'll have a chance to see the initial idea presented by a single band member, and then watch how the entire band comes together to turn that idea into a full song.\n\nIt isn't easy to form a band. Worse still, many bands fail to achieve the success that they originally set out to accomplish. With that in mind, this section also features The Successful Band MethodÃ¢â€žÂ¢. It's a simple process for establishing your musical goals, and it also includes ten important guidelines to follow in order to increase the likelihood of success.\n\nThe Shows\n\nPerforming for a live audience is one of the most exciting aspects of playing the drums; and it's why many drummers aspire to turn their passion for music into a full-time career. The video portion of this section includes detailed interviews with professional gigging drummers: Jay Deachman, Issah Contractor, and Mike Michalkow. These guys have spent many years playing drums for a living, and they have valuable advice to share with students interested in playing professionally.\n\nThis section also includes The Drummers ChecklistÃ¢â€žÂ¢. It's a list of everything you need to take to your next gig. I strongly recommend reviewing it while you pack for a show as well as prior to leaving the venue. There is nothing worse than forgetting an essential piece of gear behind!\n\nThe Music\n\nNot many drummers have the opportunity to play with other musicians on a regular basis. Yet, it is this experience that helps us mature as musicians. It gives us a chance to find our voice, improve our groove, and become more confident with our drumming abilities. With that in mind, this section includes ten fun play-along songs you can use to start building experience.\n\nYou can start by watching the video performances of each song. Then review the provided sheet music for a breakdown of what was played. Finally, you can use the drum-less audio tracks to jam along with the songs at your own kit. Each play-along is available with and without click support. Beginners should start with the click version as it makes it easier to keep time.\n\nThe Lifestyle\n\nDrumming is more than just a hobby, it's a lifestyle. This section covers three powerful tools to support and enhance your drumming lifestyle, including The Habitual DrummerÃ¢â€žÂ¢, The Inspired DrummerÃ¢â€žÂ¢, and The Connected DrummerÃ¢â€žÂ¢. These tools will help you stay focused on your goals, stay excited about playing the drums, and stay connected with other musicians.\n\nMany drummers spend a lifetime waiting for success to come their way. These tools empower you to be successful on your own terms. When you take control of your future, you'll be able to build on your rock-solid foundation and achieve success in the way that you define it!\n\nThe Making\n\nA significant amount of time and energy went into the creation of the Successful Drumming training pack. This section gives you a behind the scenes look how everything came together. You'll see how the studio was set up, how the kit was mic'd, how the core play-along songs were written and recorded, some funny outtakes from the filming process, a tour of the studio, and a few tips on how to make full use of the video lessons.\n\nYou'll also see a comprehensive breakdown of all the drum gear featured in the recording. Jared describes all of the drums, cymbals, and hardware that were used in the lessons, along with an explanation of the thought process that went into the final setup.\n\nThe Workbook\n\nThe Successful Drumming experience also includes a companion workbook that you can use to follow along with the video and audio content. Everything is organized based on the DVD sections, so you can easily find the beats, fills, and interactive worksheets that are referenced in the training videos. Likewise, you can also find reverse references from the book that point back to relevant audio or video content.\n\nThis comprehensive 274 page full-color workbook is spiral bound, so it will sit open nicely on any music stand. And you'll also get access to a digital PDF version of the workbook that can be loaded onto a tablet computer or used to print off additional copies of the interactive worksheets.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2a0636f38b482a857500ad7ab4d5b4f45fd40d6","amp;dn":"Jared+Falk+-+Succesful+Drumming+%5BComplete+Collection%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2a0636f38b482a857500ad7ab4d5b4f45fd40d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,160,99,111,56,180,130,168,87,80,10,215,171,77,91,79,69,253,64,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
