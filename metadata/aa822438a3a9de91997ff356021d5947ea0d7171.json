Their efforts have tended to go unnoticed by cinema audiences. British Film Design offers the first comprehensive historical survey of British art direction. It takes a chronological journey through British film design, starting with the efforts of the film &quot;primitives&quot; of the silent era and ending with the modern day purveyors of part built/part computer generated &quot;blended design.&quot; Certain themes recur en route. These include British cinema's obsession with realism; the Production Designer's continual struggle for recognition; influence from European artists and the benefits -- and perils -- of American finance. The book succeeds in expressing the joy of looking at films from inside out; seeing beyond the stars to recognise sets as silent players in the action.\n\nLazyTinker - TinkerTorrents - CrowNephew - AryaN_L33T - CodeBlaze - Kira - DeejayAhmed\nVisit us at www.lfrg.co.vu for more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa822438a3a9de91997ff356021d5947ea0d7171","amp;dn":"British+Film+Design+A+History+LittleFairyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa822438a3a9de91997ff356021d5947ea0d7171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,130,36,56,163,169,222,145,153,127,243,86,2,29,89,71,234,13,113,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
