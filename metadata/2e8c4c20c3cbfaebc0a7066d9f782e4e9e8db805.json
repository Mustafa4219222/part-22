An unreleased album. Excellent soundboard stereo.\n\nWhile the Grateful Dead spun psychedelic webs of anthems to the sun and dark stars, their lyricist Robert Hunter was interested in how to keep a barroom crowd content. His tools were his lyrics, melodies and a band that could play folk and country. So in 1974, when HunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut solo album arrived on the Grateful DeadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Round Records label, many missed the opportunity to pick up on it. It had flown under the rader. Hunter only borrowed Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart and the GodchauxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s from the Dead. Tales Of The Great Rum Runners was an unassuming album bolstered by HunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everyday vocals, filled with the Americana style first introduced by The BandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brown album and songs that were down to earth.\n\nJust recently, we learnt that there was an earlier attempt at an album by Hunter called Roadhogs. This was shared by Rob Berger at Losslesslegs. Six of the songs on Roadhog would later be recorded again for Tales of The Great Rum Runners. The rest were considered Ã¢â‚¬Å“lostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, till now. After trawling the net, we also found that in 1976 Hunter played gigs with a band he formed also called Roadhog. (Click here.)\n\nThe mixture of sweet ballads, mid-tempo tunes and rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll howlers probably kept this one on the shelf. Two of the tunes had an unidentified female singer. According to Berger, Rodney Albin shared some of the vocals with Hunter. Otherwise not much else is known about the personnel of this recording or how it all came about.\n\nOne song stands head and shoulders above all else, Roadhog. A tough rocker with some sterling solos. According to the notes from deaddisc.com about HunterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book, A Box Of Rain: Lyrics 1965-1993, Ã¢â‚¬Å“There are no recordings of this songÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. We can only guess it must be the after-effects of LSD.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a prostrate batter\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a number-five hatter\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a smooth-line chatter\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a roadhog\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m an up-and-comer\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a flat-out bummer\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a toll-gate jumper\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a roadhog\nyeahÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a roadhog\n\nIf any knowledgeable fan has more information, please share with the community.
