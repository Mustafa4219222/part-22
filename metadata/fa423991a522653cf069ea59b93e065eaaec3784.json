It is lit with notable characters. The reforming heroes are the Whig aristocrats led by Lord Grey, members of the richest and most landed cabinet in history yet determined to bring liberty, which would whittle away their own power, to the country. \n\nThe all-too-conservative opposition was headed by the Duke of Wellington, supported by the intransigent Queen Adelaide, with hereditary memories of the French Revolution. Finally, there were revolutionaries, like William Cobbett, the author of Rural Rides, the radical tailor Francis Place, and Thomas Attwood of Birmingham, the charismatic orator. The contest often grew violent. There were urban riots put down by soldiers and agricultural riots led by the mythical Captain Swing.\n\nThe underlying grievance was the fate of the many disfranchised people. They were ignored by a medieval system of electoral representation that gave, for example, no votes to those who lived in the new industrial cities of Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield, and Birmingham, while allocating two parliamentary representatives to a village long since fallen into the sea and, most notoriously, Old Sarum, a green mound in a field. \n\nLord John Russell, a Whig minister, said long afterwards that it was the only period when he genuinely felt popular revolution threatened the country. The Duke of Wellington declared intractably in November 1830 that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The beginning of reform is the beginning of revolution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So it seemed that disaster must fall on the British Parliament, or the monarchy, or both.\n\nThe question was: Could a rotten system reform itself in time? On June 7, 1832, the date of the extremely reluctant royal assent by William IV to the Great Reform Bill, it did. These events led to a total change in the way Britain was governed, and set the stage for its growth as the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful industrial power; admired, among other things, for its traditions of good governanceÃ¢â‚¬â€a two-year revolution that Antonia Fraser brings to vivid dramatic life.\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nAntonia Fraser has written several historical biographies which have been international bestsellers, since Mary, Queen of Scots published in 1969. These include Marie Antoinette, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, and Cromwell. Other historical works include The Weaker Vessel: WomanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lot in Seventeenth Century England, and Faith and Treason: the Gunpowder Plot. \n\nAntonia Fraser was president of English Pen, the world-wide writersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ organization for free speech, and is now a vice-president. She has received many prizes, including the Wolfson History Award, the Norton Medlicott Historical Association Medal, the Franco-British Literary Prize, and the St. Louis Literary Award. She was made a D.B.E (Dame) in 2011 for services to literature. She was married to the Nobel Laureate, Harold Pinter, who died in 2008.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | History | Britain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa423991a522653cf069ea59b93e065eaaec3784","amp;dn":"Perilous+Question%3A+Reform+or+Revolution%3F+Britain+on+the+Brink...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa423991a522653cf069ea59b93e065eaaec3784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,66,57,145,165,34,101,60,240,105,234,89,185,62,6,94,170,236,55,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
