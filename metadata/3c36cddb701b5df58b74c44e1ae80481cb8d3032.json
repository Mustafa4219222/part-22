The story is one that has been passed down through from father to son for generations. As the grandfather reads the story, the action comes alive. The story is a classic tale of love and adventure as the beautiful Buttercup is kidnapped and held against her will in order to marry the odious Prince Humperdinck, and Westley (her childhood beau, now returned as the Dread Pirate Roberts) attempts to save her. On the way he meets an accomplished swordsman and a huge, super strong giant, both of whom become his companions in his quest. They meet a few bad guys along the way to rescue Buttercup.

Also after everyone is nasty Prince Humperdinck to whom Buttercup is now betrothed but who seems to care little for her continued survival. The stage is set for swordfights, monsters, and tortures - but will Grandpa be allowed to finish telling the story with all these kissy bits?

Fire Swamps, that is. Full of quicksand and Rodents of Unusual Size. Lagoons were inhabited by shrieking eels. And the most beautiful woman in the world was named . . . Buttercup? Well, it\\&amp;#039;s a bent fairy tale. Complete with all the fencing, chasing, escapes, and silly accents you\\&amp;#039;d expect. Including such unique folk as Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who has dreamt his whole life of finding the six-fingered man who killed his father. Andre the Giant as his enormous sidekick. And Billy Crystal as the kvetching miracle man, Max. Blonde Buttercup loves Westley, a poor stable boy. But when he\\&amp;#039;s captured by pirates, she\\&amp;#039;s chosen by evil Prince Humperdinck to be his princess bride. Along the way, she gets kidnapped, he gets killed. But it all ends up okay.

To cheer his grandson up, Grandpa has brought a storybook; The Princess Bride, a tale of the love between the beautiful Buttercup and the besotted Westley, a love cruelly interrupted by Westley\\&amp;#039;s tragic apparent death at sea when seeking his fortune. Heartbroken, Buttercup has sworn never to love again, but accepts the marriage proposal of the rich and handsome Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin; but death is no barrier to true love, and in a story filled with exotically-accented swordsmen, big-hearted giants, genius kidnappers, sadistic torturers, vile swamps, Rodents of Unusual Size, the Dread Pirate Roberts and a somewhat embittered miracle worker, the love between Westley and Buttercup twists and turns on a path filled with adventure. Will the True Love of Westley and Buttercup win the day? Will Inigo Montaya find the six-fingered man who murdered his father? Will Humperdinck\\&amp;#039;s evil plans come to fruition? And, more importantly, will Grandpa be able to tell the story without any of the yucky","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c36cddb701b5df58b74c44e1ae80481cb8d3032","amp;dn":"La+princesa+prometida+%2F+The+princess+Bride","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c36cddb701b5df58b74c44e1ae80481cb8d3032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,54,205,219,112,27,93,245,139,116,196,78,26,232,4,129,203,141,48,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
