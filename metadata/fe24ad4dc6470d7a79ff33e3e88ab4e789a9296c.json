They shot the footage which constitutes this short documentary all in one day - Tuesday 13. The film is the story of that day, and what happened to the North Vietnamese people in the course of it.\n\nColour is used only in the introductory section on the history of Vietnam, and how the almond-eyed Vietnamese have always been willing to sacrifice their blood to repel invaders. The Chinese, the Cambodians, the Siamese, the French - all have tried to conquer Vietnam and all have been repulsed.\n\nThen we move to black and white for a satirical biography of Lyndon Johnson. A caption tells us of Johnson's birth in 1908, and in a sequence of rapid cuts we are shown archive film of various animals energing from wombs, interspersed with volcanos spewing out magma. Johnson becomes president and the film concentrates on the anti-war protests which dogged his public appearances. His limousine and security men are splashed with paint, and students are manhandled by police. Still photos of Johnson are presented in a satirical montage, aiming to make Johnson look weary and disheartened.\n\nThe bulk of the documentary is wordless, allowing the images to speak for themselves. It is accompanied by a truly marvellous musical score.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Hanoi, martes 13.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 520 MiB\n      Duration : 37mn 39s\n      Overall bit rate : 1 930 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 37mn 39s\n      Bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Width : 608 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.583\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.309\n      Stream size : 466 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 37mn 39s\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 51.7 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150818/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0150818/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; multilanguage subpack (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese)\n\nMy rip\n\nSantiago Alvarez - Hanoi, martes 13 (1967)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe24ad4dc6470d7a79ff33e3e88ab4e789a9296c","amp;dn":"Santiago+Alvarez+-+Hanoi%2C+martes+13+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe24ad4dc6470d7a79ff33e3e88ab4e789a9296c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,36,173,77,198,71,13,122,121,255,51,227,232,138,180,231,137,169,41,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
