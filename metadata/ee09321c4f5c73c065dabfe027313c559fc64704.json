And, more often than not, when you use the Windows Add/Remove Program utility, there are remnants or &quot;artifacts&quot; of the program left behind in the system registry and on your hard drive that are no longer needed. These useless items will bog your PC down and, over time, it will get slower and slower lugging around this useless baggage - unexpected errors and frequent crashes may also occur because of this!\n\nWhat's the problem?\n\nLet's say you frequently install trial versions of programs to check them out. And let's also say that, after giving them a shot, you don't like them and decide to uninstall them. Unfortunately, you find it impossible to uninstall some of them - they remain on the Windows installed programs list even they are &quot;supposedly&quot; gone.
