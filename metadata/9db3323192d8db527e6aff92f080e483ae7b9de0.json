Buddha. Jesus. Muhammad. Four extraordinary sages who influenced world civilization more deeply than any other human beings in history. As just one measure of their importance, current rankings of the most influential people in history consistently put them at or near the top of the list. Four centuries after the rise of the scientific worldview, their influence in human affairs continues to be fundamental, underscoring issues ranging from questions of ethics and justice to religious and political conflicts to other issues that dominate today's headlines.\n\nFour Exemplars of Noble Living\nConfucius, the Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad were all born into ancient cultures in the midst of tumultuous changes. Each addressed fundamental existential problems within their societies, developing codes of ethics and behavior that broke with the past, and offering bold new visions of human life.\n\nGrounding your inquiry in the dramatic historical settings of their teachings, you explore and define the unique contributions of each man:\n\nConfucius: China's primordial philosopher/sage, whose teaching integrally shaped the Chinese constructs of government, human relations, culture, and history. You study the system of Confucian thought that formed the basis of Chinese education for 2,000 years, founded on the sage's core precepts of &quot;uncommon&quot; humaneness, reciprocity, and the creative power of virtue.\n\nThe Buddha: The high-born prince who turned his back on a life of privilege to follow an unrelenting quest for the &quot;supreme state of sublime peace.&quot; You dig deeply into the Buddha's teachings on the nature of reality, the delusions of human perception, and the practical means for ending suffering.\n\nJesus of Nazareth: Beloved icon of Christianity, a revered prophet in Islam, and the dominant figure in Western culture for nearly two millennia. You explore his archetypal dual role as both harbinger of God's kingdom and spiritual teacher, and you see how his teachings revealed a liberating alternative to humanity's oppressive inequities.\n\nMuhammad: Al-Lah's &quot;last&quot; prophet and the central example of the faithful Muslim. His teachings brought Islam into being even as he struggled with the roles of both political and military leader of his community. You study Muhammad's teachings on the oneness and inscrutability of the absolute, his dynamic vision of ethical action, and Islam's complex spiritual disciplines.\n\n\n36 Lectures\n____\n\nA Quartet of Sages\n\nConfucius's China\n\nBecoming a Sage\n\nA Gentleman and a Scholar\n\nHeaven and Earth\n\nDoing unto Others\n\nHow to Rule a Kingdom\n\nWhat a Sage Does\n\nConfucius and Confucianism\n\nIndia at the Time of the Buddha\n\nSiddhattha Gotama\n\nThe First and Second Great Awakenings\n\nKnowing the World\n\nCan't Get No Satisfaction\n\nGetting to the Farther Shore\n\nHow the Buddha Taught\n\nThe Buddha and Buddhism\n\nThe Jewish and Roman Worlds of Jesus\n\nThe Son of Mary\n\nThe First 30 Years\n\nThe Kingdom of God\n\nBack to the Future\n\nJesus's Christology\n\nThe Last Days in Jerusalem\n\nHow Jesus Became Christ\n\nArabia in the Days of Ignorance\n\nThe Trustworthy One\n\n&quot;I Am Only a Messenger&quot;\n\nMadinah\n\nThe Ethics of Islam\n\nThe Greater Jihad\n\nThe Conquest of Makkah\n\nTheir Lives Compared\n\nTheir Teachings Compared\n\nTheir Enduring Significance\n___\n\nTake this rare chance, in Confucius, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, to taste the authentic, living wisdom of these visionary sages and to understand the sources of their monumental role in our world.\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
