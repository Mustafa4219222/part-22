Young girls receive these messages daily hundreds of times. But who sets these impossible beauty standardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how can they be changed? In this eye-opening documentary, filmmaker and former Elite International fashion model Nicole Clark, now a champion for young girls and their self-esteem, calls for a necessary change: integrity and responsible media for our youth. \n\nCOVER GIRL CULTURE pairs images of girls and women in television and print ads with footage from the catwalks and celebrity media. Clark is given rare access to women editors from major magazines like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Teen VogueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ELLEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, who provide a shocking defense of the fashion and advertising worlds. The film juxtaposes these interviews with revealing insights from models, parents, teachers, psychologists, body image experts and most importantly, the heartfelt expressions of girls themselves on how they feel about the media that surrounds them. \n\nWith an insiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s view, the film addresses issues like todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s increasingly invasive media, heightened advertising to tweens, the sexualization of girls, and consumer cultureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disempowerment of young women. An up-to-date inquiry into advertising and the cult of celebrityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deep and negative impact on teens and young women, COVER GIRL CULTURE also suggests how to educate young women to think critically about the media.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf453225ba472b7ad30fb5c33d035d667d67758d","amp;dn":"Cover+Girl+Culture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf453225ba472b7ad30fb5c33d035d667d67758d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,69,50,37,186,71,43,122,211,15,181,195,61,3,93,102,125,103,117,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
