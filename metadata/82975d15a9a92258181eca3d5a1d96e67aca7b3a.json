It is a light-hearted musical comedy-drama about a new young priest (Bing Crosby) taking over a parish from an established old veteran (Barry Fitzgerald). Crosby sings five songs in the film. It was followed the next year by a sequel, The Bells of St. Mary's. This picture was the highest-grossing picture of 1944. Its success helped to make movie exhibitors choose Crosby as the biggest box-office draw of the year, a record he would hold for the remainder of the 1940s.\n\nPLOT\n\nThe film follows Father Charles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChuckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley (Bing Crosby), an incoming priest whose unconventional style transforms the parish life of St. DominicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s church in New York City.\n\nWe meet OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley on his first day at the new parish. O'Malley gets into a series of mishaps on his way to the church, and his informal appearance and attitude make a very poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald). The highly-traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢MalleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recreational habits - particularly his golf-playing - and his friendship with the even more casual pastor Timmy OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Dowd. In a discussion between O'Malley and O'Dowd without Fitzgibbon present, it is revealed that OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor. To spare FitzgibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s feelings, the older pastor is kept unaware of this arrangement and believes that OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley is simply his assistant.\n\nA series of events in the first half of the film highlight the differences between OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley and FitzgibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s styles, as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman coming to the church having run away from home. The most consequential difference of opinion between OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley and Fitzgibbon arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi (Stanley Clements). Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley instead seeks to make inroads into the boysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually using this connection to convince the boys, against some initial reluctance, to become a church choir.\n\nThe noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who finally decides to go to the bishop and ask for OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley to be transferred away. In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intention to put OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley in charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, instead of making his initial request, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate of losing control over the church, he informs OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley of his new role.\n\nDistressed, Fitzgibbon then runs away from the parish, leading to a search. He returns late at night, and as OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley puts the older priest to bed, the two begin to bond, discussing FitzgibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s long-put-off desire to go to Ireland and see his mother, whom he hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t seen in 45 years, and who is now over 90. OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œToo-ra-loo-ra-loo-ralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nWe now meet Jenny Linden, an old girlfriend of O'Malley's whom he left in order to join the priesthood, but who has since risen to a highly successful acting and singing career. O'Malley and Jenny discuss their past, and he then watches from the side of the stage as she performs a number for her starring role as Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nO'Malley next pays a visit to the young woman who was earlier seen running away from home, who is now suspected of living in sin with the son of the church's mortgage-holder. On this visit, OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgo his wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which to him means to follow after the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same. He performs for them the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoing My WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which he wrote on this theme.\n\nThe elements of the story now begin to come together. Jenny visits OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley at the church, sees the boysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ choir, and reads the sheet music of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoing My WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. She, O'Malley, and Father OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, perform ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGoing My WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the choir and a full orchestra, and sell the rights to the song, thereby saving the church from its financial woes. The plan fails, as the music executive brought on to listen to the song does not believe that it will sell. As the executive is leaving, the choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings another song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSwinging on a StarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The executive overhears the song and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.\n\nWith the church affairs in order, OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley and Fitzgibbon begin to bond more closely, and even go out on the golf course together. Just as everything seems to have fallen into place, though, the parish church is damaged in a massive fire. At about the same time, O'Malley prepares to move on to a new assignment from the bishop. He leaves OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Dowd as FitzgibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new assistant, and puts Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. On Christmas Eve the people gather in a temporary church, in a service that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a going away present to Fitzgibbon, OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley flies FitzgibbonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother in from Ireland. As mother and son embrace in front of the church while the choir sings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œToo-ra-loo-ra-loo-ralÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, Father OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Malley quietly slips away.\n\nCast\n\nBing Crosby              Father Chuck O'Malley\nBarry Fitzgerald         Father Fitzgibbon\nFrank McHugh             Father Timothy O'Dowd\nJames Brown              Ted Haines, Jr.\nGene Lockhart            Ted Haines, Sr.\nRisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Stevens             Genevieve Linden\nJean Heather             Carol James\nPorter Hall              Mr. Belknap\nFortunio Bonanova        Tomaso Bozanni\nEily Malyon              Mrs. Carmody\nStanley Clements         Tony Scaponi\nCarl &quot;Alfalfa&quot; Switzer   Herman Langer\nWilliam Frawly           Music Executive (He played Fred Mertz on &quot;I LOVE LUCY&quot;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82975d15a9a92258181eca3d5a1d96e67aca7b3a","amp;dn":"Best+Picture+-+1944+-+Going+My+Way+%28Bing+Crosby%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82975d15a9a92258181eca3d5a1d96e67aca7b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,151,93,21,169,169,34,88,24,30,202,61,90,29,150,230,122,202,123,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
