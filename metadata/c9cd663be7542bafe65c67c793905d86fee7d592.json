Enjoy, as she inflicts all\n            manner of suffering on her parents, without conscience or remorse! Her\n            babysitter is Flower, who must also contend with the unwanted attentions\n            of (lovesick) Dick. He's the friendly neighbourhood stalker, totally\n            besotted with Flower... and never far away! Raising Amy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ she's armed,\n            she's dangerous, and she's a proper Scottish ginger nutcase! Just be\n            thankful she's not yours! &quot;\n\n              -- &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.markosia.com/titles/raising-amy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.markosia.com/titles/raising-amy&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n          In addition to the above, it should be mentioned that this is a collection\n          of comic strips rather than a comic book proper. The bad news is that the\n          quality isn't great. Each strip is 1920 pixels wide, which ought to be\n          plenty, but the images are over-compressed, and the style of the artwork\n          is such that encoding artefacts show up very clearly indeed.
