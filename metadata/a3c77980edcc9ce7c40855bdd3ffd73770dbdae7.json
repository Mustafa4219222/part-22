Savagely murdered and then resurrected in a bizarre scientific experiment, Fred is without his memory or his head! The game immerses players in the vicious action as they collect, upgrade and switch heads on the fly to strategically fight malformed mutants, ghoulish gangsters, and maniacal mob bosses in a unique and compelling story of revenge and redemption.\n\nWiki:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Head_Fred&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Head_Fred&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIGN Rating:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/dead-head-fred/psp-826383&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/dead-head-fred/psp-826383&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lAOKDAAef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/lAOKDAAef&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou shouldn't need Xpadder for this, but I have included it anyway.\n\nExtract with WinRAR, or 7zip.\n\nI recommend:\n\nWindows XP / 7 / 8 32 or 64bit OS\n\nCore 2 duo 2.0 or above\n\nA reasonable graphics card\n\n3 gig of ram\n\n1.4 Gig of Hard drive space.\n\nThis emulates very well, I'm playing this on 52&quot; LCD-TV and the graphics are as you would expect from a good PC game.\n\nEnjoy this whacky game, and please seed for others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c77980edcc9ce7c40855bdd3ffd73770dbdae7","amp;dn":"Dead+Head+Fred+%28Emulated+for+PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c77980edcc9ce7c40855bdd3ffd73770dbdae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,199,121,128,237,204,156,231,196,8,85,189,211,255,215,55,112,219,218,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
