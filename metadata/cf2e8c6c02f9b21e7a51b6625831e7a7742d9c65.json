Friis is a journalist by training, while KaaberbÃƒÂ¸l has been a professional writer since the age of 15, with more than 2 million books sold worldwide. Their first collaboration, The Boy in the Suitcase, was a New York Times and USA Today bestseller, and has been translated into 27 languages.\n\nThe Boy in the Suitcase (#1): Nina Borg, a Red Cross nurse, wife, and mother of two, is a compulsive do-gooder who can't say no when someone asks for helpÃ¢â‚¬â€even when she knows better. When her estranged friend Karin leaves her a key to a public locker in the Copenhagen train station, Nina gets suckered into her most dangerous project yet. Inside the locker is a suitcase, and inside the suitcase is a three-year-old boy: naked and drugged, but alive. Is the boy a victim of child trafficking? Can he be turned over to authorities, or will they only return him to whoever sold him? When Karin is discovered brutally murdered, Nina realizes that her life and the boy's are in jeopardy, too. In an increasingly desperate trek across Denmark, Nina tries to figure out who the boy is, where he belongs, and who exactly is trying to hunt him down.\n\nInvisible Murder (#2): In the ruins of an abandoned Soviet military hospital in northern Hungary, two impoverished Roma boys are scavenging for old supplies or weapons they could sell on the black market when they find more than they ever anticipated. The resulting chain of events threatens to blow the lives of a frightening number of people into bits and pieces. Danish Red Cross nurse Nina Borg doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realize she is putting life and family on the line when she tries to treat a group of sick Hungarian gypsies who are living illegally in a Copenhagen garage. Nina has unwittingly thrown herself into a deadly nest of the unscrupulous and the desperate, and what is at stake is much more terrifying than anyone had realized.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Mobi. Excellent writing duo. The Danish can challenge Norway, Sweden, and Finland word for word.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf2e8c6c02f9b21e7a51b6625831e7a7742d9c65","amp;dn":"Nina+Borg+Series+%28ePub%2C+Mobi+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf2e8c6c02f9b21e7a51b6625831e7a7742d9c65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,46,140,108,2,249,178,30,122,81,182,98,88,49,231,167,116,45,156,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
