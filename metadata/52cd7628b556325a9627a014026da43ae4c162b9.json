It remains a significant single as the Stones have not been back into the UK Top 10 since. It was #1 during 13 weeks on Billboard&amp;#039;s Mainstream Rock Tracks. The B-Side was a slow blues number called &quot;No Use In Crying&quot; which also featured on the Tattoo You album. A popular music video was produced for the single, directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg.\n\n&quot;Start Me Up&quot; is often used to open the Stones&amp;#039; live shows and has been featured on the live albums Still Life, Flashpoint, Live Licks, and Shine a Light. It has been included on every major compilation since its release, including Rewind (1971-1984), Jump Back (1993), and Forty Licks (2002).\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52cd7628b556325a9627a014026da43ae4c162b9","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Start+Me+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52cd7628b556325a9627a014026da43ae4c162b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,205,118,40,181,86,50,90,150,39,160,20,2,109,164,58,228,193,98,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
