Would like to see it as a hardcover omnibus edition with each book (1-4) as a chapter.\n\n... until I went to the Humanoids website to grab a blurb and found out they already have an oversized deluxe edition in print. Sweet!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCape Horn 1-4 (digital)\n\nHumanoids, 2014, 57 pages each\n\nWritten by Christian Perrissin\n\nIllustrated by Enea Riboldi\n\nColored by Studio KMzero: Cosimo Lorenzo Pancini, Simone Missoni, Naomi Mallegini, Linda Cavallini\n\nBook 1: The Eastern-Facing Bay\nBook 2: In the Cormorants' Wake\nBook 3: The Black Angel Of Paramo\nBook 4: The Soulful Prince\n\nThe &quot;Land of Fire&quot; is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland. As the 19th century comes to a close, it is a vast and desolate land only frequented by gold diggers, English missionaries, Chilean and Argentine military, and the age-old Ona, Alacaluf, and Yamana tribes. In this unique world, where the Andean mountains plunge into the Pacific Ocean, several characters, each burdened by duty or fate, will cross paths and clash, on their journey through Cape Horn.
