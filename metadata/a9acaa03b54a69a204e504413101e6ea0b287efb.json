Hold My Hand [6:11]\n\nIn Blood Memory is the latest recorded offering from somewhat reclusive Melbournian singer-songwriter Jen Cloher. (Jen, where've you been these past five years since you last released an album?).\nIt's her third album and it opens with 'Mount Beauty' which, by dint of its slightly menacing, anarchic opening, puts me in mind of Ed Kuepper. It's to do with the heavy toms, tormented surf guitar and muted electric bass, I think. If you told me Ed produced it, I'd believe you. It's the latest single and is accompanied by a riveting clip that's like a four-minute feature. But did I hear right? &quot;On the same day we first met, one year on I met your dad; I don't think you knew that we were lovers once?&quot; Whoa! That's one hell of an opener. Speaking of hell, Jen might be looking and sounding serious, but something tells me she's relaxed a little, into a gentle kind of self-parody, as she also takes a lighter look at life. The evidence? &quot;I know it's kind of silly, now, but last year, man, it hurt like hell!&quot; OK. So love hurts. But, yeah, anyone who's been in and out of it knows that, sooner or later, one way or another, you do get over it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9acaa03b54a69a204e504413101e6ea0b287efb","amp;dn":"Jen+Cloher+-+In+Blood+Memory+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9acaa03b54a69a204e504413101e6ea0b287efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,172,170,3,181,74,105,162,4,229,4,65,49,1,230,234,11,40,126,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
