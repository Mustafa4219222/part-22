When Connie begins to talk about marriage, Bilge quickly diverts his attention towards a friend of Sherry's, Iris (Astrid Allwyn), a divorced socialite.\nThe sailors return to sea while Connie seeks to raise money to salvage her deceased sea-captain father's sailing ship. When the boys return to San Francisco, Bake attempts to get Sherry a job in a Broadway show, but fails amidst a flurry of mistaken identities and misunderstandings. He redeems himself by staging a benefit show which raises the final seven hundred dollars needed to refurbish the ship.\nAfter the concert, Bake and Sherry are offered a show on Broadway which Bake accepts on the proviso that Sherry asks him to marry her.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:867ce0755bc69ae41106764855361eb60fda0abf","amp;dn":"Follow+the+fleet+%281936%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"867ce0755bc69ae41106764855361eb60fda0abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,124,224,117,91,198,154,228,17,6,118,72,85,54,30,182,15,218,10,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
