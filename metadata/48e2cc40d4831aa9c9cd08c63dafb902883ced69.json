Ruins,\nNationalparks, Ksars, wells and other sight seeings!\n\nThe accuracy of this map is good because I use only GPS recorded tracks!\n(I didn't vectorize in any way a raster map like other maps). The map is\nvery small with a lot of informations and very fast in the GPS device.\n\nThe autorouting is very simple (not that good compared to prof. maps.)\nBut you can use it for calculating distances. Don't use it in the cities\nor highway!\n\nThe map is Trackware! Send me your tracks, but only tracks and waypoints\nwhich are not already on the map.\n\nTracks: only from dirt roads and paved roads (not off road tracks). Good\nquality (i.e. at least every 50 m a point).\n\nWaypoints: Cities, Villages, Hotels, Restaurants, Fuel stops, Car\nServices, wells (Sahara), nice picnic places, sight seeings, etc. etc.\nAll waypoints which are useful for the Tunisia traveller.\n\nPS: If you have Tunisia  &gt; V10 the existings installations will be overwritten!\n\n\nThis map is not locked.\nIt is free, updates can be also freely downloaded from the address above!\n\n\nThis one goes to:\noneeyedcat at 2009-01-12 14:09 CET:\n&quot;have you got or is there a tunisie map avilable.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e2cc40d4831aa9c9cd08c63dafb902883ced69","amp;dn":"Garmin+MapSource+Tunisia+v11+by+4x4travel.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e2cc40d4831aa9c9cd08c63dafb902883ced69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,226,204,64,212,131,26,169,201,205,8,198,61,175,185,2,136,60,237,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
