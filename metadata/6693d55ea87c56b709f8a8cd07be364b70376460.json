Some of the material here may seem disagreeable. \n\nWe advise that Gracian's writings be taken with lots of contemplation, it might help to absorb the material slowly and then explore it further.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6693d55ea87c56b709f8a8cd07be364b70376460","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Worldly+Wisdom+-+Balthasar+Gracian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6693d55ea87c56b709f8a8cd07be364b70376460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,147,213,94,168,124,86,183,9,248,168,205,7,190,54,75,112,55,100,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
