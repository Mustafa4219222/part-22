But this time, Saturn Girl becomes a psychic conduit for Psycho's evil mental powers, causing everyone around the Legionnaire to be caught up in the psychedelic madness.\n\n\n\n\nThanks goes to OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O and Avalon for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5248aae7f35f3409da2332f851272b319388e5a","amp;dn":"Legion+of+Super-Heroes+%281997-02%29+89-90+%28hybrid%29+%28OkC.O.M.P.U.T.O","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5248aae7f35f3409da2332f851272b319388e5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,36,138,174,127,53,243,64,157,162,51,47,133,18,114,179,25,56,142,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
