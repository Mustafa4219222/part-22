But his hardass parole officer won't let him leave town, and Mick finds himself washing dishes in a diner for another ex-con. Eventually, though, he manages to slip his leash and get to the big city, where he quickly finds himself neck-deep in trouble with a local crimeboss, King Silver. You see, Mick's there to deliver a message to the sister of his former cellmate, Doug Orten Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the man's final words after taking a shiv meant for Mick - and that message may be a clue to the location of a cache of money that Orten stole from King Silver. Needless to say, Silver wants his money -  and so do a lot of other folks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:826034bd906b3cfc4bf89b7e9739c80efacbb333","amp;dn":"Damned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"826034bd906b3cfc4bf89b7e9739c80efacbb333","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,96,52,189,144,107,60,252,75,248,155,126,151,57,200,14,250,203,179,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
