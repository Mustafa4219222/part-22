It was\n developed in conjunction with the French company Ultimate Sound Bank and used their 32-bit UVI\n audio engine. As a virtual instrument that could run on Mac or PC, it was available in all the\n major plug-in formats, and could load samples and patches in almost any current or legacy format.\n It also supported multi-channel surround as well as conventional mono and stereo audio, which was\n an impressive feature at the time. In short, there was a lot to like about MachFive, and it quite\n rightly attracted a lot of good reviews (not least from Sound On Sound) and loyal followers\n\nNumber of Sounds: 736 Preset\n\n Instrument Groups: Bass, Pad ,Orchestral ,Guitar ,Synth ,Ethno ,Keys \n\nUnzip with BetterZip.\n-.Toast image file - mount and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15afaa965fc4f765f799ce1073f5bd37b664b4e2","amp;dn":"MOTU.MachFive2.MegaSoundlibrary.MacOSX.Intel.MsGS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15afaa965fc4f765f799ce1073f5bd37b664b4e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,175,170,150,95,196,247,101,247,153,206,16,115,245,189,55,182,100,180,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
