It is configured by default to automatically Integrate into your Explorer or Netscape browser when it is installed, and to self-activate each\ntime a download is performed.\n\nNo further configuration or action is required on your part - simply use your browser to access the desired site, click on the download file, and respond to the self-explanatory DAP dialogs that appear.\n\nAdvanced options enable you to tailor the operation and responses of the application to your needs. You can choose to trigger specific responses such as messages, queue update, closing the application, and disconnecting after the download is completed or is not available.\n\nDAP is fully integrated into the browser, providing the best possible performance from ANY Internet connection, broadband and narrowband (cable, DSL / ADSL, T1, dial-up etc.).\n\nDAP will allow you to benefit from a faster and more reliable download experience, optimize your download performance, and help you to recover interrupted downloads. DAP is available in two versions: a Free version (ads. supported) and a Premium version (with a richer set of features and no ads.).\n\nPlease seed after downloading. \n\nPlease comment if the torrent has some problems.\n\nBrainBUGGER never uploads useless torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6943467478d1088963645caa12896e4e99de823","amp;dn":"SPEEDBIT+Download+Accelerator+Plus+8.6+%2B+Patch+%21%21%21+-+BrainBUGGER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6943467478d1088963645caa12896e4e99de823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,148,52,103,71,141,16,136,150,54,69,202,161,40,150,228,233,157,232,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
