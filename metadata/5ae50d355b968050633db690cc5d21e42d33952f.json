In fact, the islands of the Caribbean were forged by volcanoes 150 million years ago, with plant and animal life following some 70 million years later. Typical of the BBC Atlas of the Natural World series is Jaguar's extraordinary photography: frogs and insects suddenly caught in flowing tree sap, crocodiles leaping to pull prey from trees. The story of the Mayans-farmers, astronomers, inventors-moving from the deserts of Mexico down to the jungles of Central America, their lives sustained by slash-and-burn agriculture and good nutrition, is thoroughly covered. So is the tale of the lost civilization of the Aztecs, wanderers for ten generations, who viewed themselves as a chosen people, acted as extinguishers of other peoples in Mexico, and were themselves ultimately destroyed by Spanish conquistadors.\n\n\n\n3)  Hunters of the Caribbean Sea \nPart 3 of &quot;Spirits of the Jaguar&quot; recounts the evolution of the Taino civilization. The Taino were the first inhabitants of the Caribbean some 2000 years ago, and their way of life was destroyed with the arrival of European explorers. The hour examines marine life that provided food for the Amerindians.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img29.imageshack.us/img29/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img838.imageshack.us/img838/226/spiritsofthejaguarscree.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1797 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 544\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.324 (4:3)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 50.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 700 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Thanks To llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/spirits/html/mayabodymaya.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/spirits/html/mayabodymaya.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ae50d355b968050633db690cc5d21e42d33952f","amp;dn":"BBC+Spirits+of+the+Jaguar+3of4+Hunters+of+the+Caribbean+Sea+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ae50d355b968050633db690cc5d21e42d33952f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,229,13,53,91,150,128,80,99,61,182,144,204,93,33,228,45,51,149,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
