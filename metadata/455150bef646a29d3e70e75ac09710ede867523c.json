In last nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s show, she performed her own composition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“When I Held YaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been getting everyone so worked up.\n\nWhy?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nWell because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s really quite amazing! Lyrically and melodically, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a beautiful song. And its simplicity gives it an extra added layer of beauty on top of that. The melody of the chorus is delightfully infectious. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not difficult to see why viewers have fallen in love with it.\n\nWhat is more difficult to work out though, is whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best for Moa in the competition. If she goes and wins it, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be obliged to release the standard winnerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s single, and then will probably have to wait a little while to unleash ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“When I Held YaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. So in actual fact, Moa herself, and Universal Music, are probably hoping that she gets knocked out of the contest ASAP ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thus enabling her to release this as a single while last nightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance is still on everyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minds, AND go into the studio to record that massive selling hit album sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gonna have regardless of whether she wins the show or leaves next week.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455150bef646a29d3e70e75ac09710ede867523c","amp;dn":"Moa+Lignell+-+When+I+Held+Ya+%5BGA645Zi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455150bef646a29d3e70e75ac09710ede867523c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,81,80,190,246,70,162,157,62,112,231,90,192,151,16,237,232,103,82,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
