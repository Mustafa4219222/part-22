Surely amidst the immensity of the cosmos there must be other intelligent life out there. Don't be so sure, says John Gribbin, one of today's best popular science writers. In this fascinating and intriguing new book, Gribbin argues that the very existence of intelligent life anywhere in the cosmos is, from an astrophysicist's point of view, a miracle. So why is there life on Earth and (seemingly) nowhere else? What happened to make this planet special? Taking us back some 600 million years, Gribbin lets you experience the series of unique cosmic events that were responsible for our unique form of life within the Milky Way Galaxy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb5c497e54f804b3ebe87d5db130b88ce3c4f6e6","amp;dn":"John+Gribbin+-+Alone+in+the+Universe%3A+Why+Our+Planet+Is+Unique+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb5c497e54f804b3ebe87d5db130b88ce3c4f6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,92,73,126,84,248,4,179,235,232,125,93,177,48,184,140,227,196,246,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
