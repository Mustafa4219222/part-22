Flat Tx Audio allows for backward compatibility and should \nonly be enable with full knowledge of the option board type to be used.\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n--------------------\nOperating Systems: Windows 95, Windows 98, Window NT 4.0,\n                   Windows ME, Windows 2000 Professional, \n                   Windows XP (Home and Office)\n\nHardware Requirements:      \nProcessor       Pentium II 333 or higher\nMemory          64 MB RAM recommended \nHard Disk Space 16 MB minimum Free Space \nPeripherals     Microsoft Windows supported Mouse or Trackball\n                Microsoft Windows supported Serial Port for radio communication\n                Microsoft Windows supported Printer Port for report printing\n                1.44 MB 3 1/2 inch Floppy Disk Drive\n                CD-ROM for software installation\n                \nKnown CPS Issues:\n----------------  \n\n1) If your PC is running the first release of Microsoft Windows 95\n   and Internet Explorer has not been installed, you may experience\n   problems in installing and running the CPS due to certain\n   components of the operating system being out of date.\n\n   To eliminate this problem two Microsoft patches have been included\n   on the CPS CD. If you experience any problems under Windows 95,\n   please go to the CD and run:\n     /Win95Patches/40comupd.exe\n     /Win95Patches/dcom95.exe\n   and then re-install the CPS. \n \n2) On some PCs, the CPS may abnormally terminate if Print Preview\n   is attempted on the Print Custom screen. This problem only occurs\n   when Print All is selected. This problem has been observed on \n   Compaq Windows 98 computers with the following programs running:\n      * Easy Access Internet Program (cpqEasyAcc.exe)\n      * Compaq Internet Watchdog Program (watchdog.exe)\n   If this CPS function is to be used, it is recommended that these \n   programs be removed from the PC startup.  \n\n3) When the tree view is printed some nodes may overlap on the\n   printout and an extra blank page may be printed. This issue\n   is more likely to occur on large codeplug configurations.   \n\n4) On some printers, the columns in some printed tables might be\n   slightly wider than they should be, causing the table to spread \n   horizontally onto a second page.\n\n5) Emergency Revert Personalities assigned on the Signaling Configuration Page\n   will not be tracked if the personality being referenced is moved in the tree\n   view.\n\n6) On certain HP Laserjet printers the Print Summary option will only print\n   one page. If you experience this problem, it is recommended that you first\n   save the information to a file and then use any Editor (Word, Wordpad, etc..)\n   to open the file and print the summary information.\n\n7) When in Windows ME and Windows XP, sometimes an extra set of scroll bars get \n   displayed when viewing certain screens.  \n\n\nProgramming Hints:\n------------------\n\n1) It should be noted that a new/added conventional personality \n   must be assigned to a zone/channel position. To add a zone to \n   a radio click the \\&quot;+\\&quot; in a Personality Assignment to Zone \n   Window. To add a conventional personality to the radio, click \n   the \\&quot;+\\&quot; on a Conventional Personality Window. To add an \n   additional conventional personality to a zone go to the \n   Personality Assignment to Zone:Channel window for the \n   desired zone.  Click the right mouse key within the channel \n   table to add a conventional personality entry. Please read \n   the CPS help for additional information. \n\n2) Speed Dial buttons should not be programmed to the P1, P2, and\n   P3 buttons on radios, which overlay these buttons with the menu \n   navigation keys. The speed dial buttons will not operate \n   in this configuration because the buttons function as the menu\n   navigation keys when phone mode is entered. \n\n3) When adding a new conventional personality, verify that the\n   bandwidth selected on the Conventional Personality  Basic screen is \n   correct.  Incorrect selections will lead to poor radio \n   performance.  \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45c6dedc9d386eba977c65a5a735e8909b36e185","amp;dn":"Motorola+RSS+CPS06.04AA+for+HT750%2F1250%2F1550+and+CDM750%2FCDM1250%2F1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45c6dedc9d386eba977c65a5a735e8909b36e185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,198,222,220,157,56,110,186,151,124,101,165,167,53,232,144,155,54,225,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
