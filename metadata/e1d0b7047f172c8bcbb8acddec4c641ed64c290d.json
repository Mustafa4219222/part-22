In 1997, as a member of the Alpha Tau Omega Fraternity, he was featured in Rolling Stone as the &quot;top partier&quot; at Florida State University, the &quot;top party school in the US&quot;, while he was in his sixth year of college. The Rolling Stone article was the inspiration for the 2002 movie Van Wilder. From 2000 to 2001, he was the co-host of the FX Network variety show, The X Show. A segment that aired on the show, &quot;Ass Wax&quot;, where Kreischer had his hair removed with hot wax, led Kreischer to gain his own show on the FX Network, titled Hurt Bert, in 2004. In the same year, he had a role in an episode of the police drama The Shield.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #305 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1d0b7047f172c8bcbb8acddec4c641ed64c290d","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23305+-+Bert+Kreischer+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1d0b7047f172c8bcbb8acddec4c641ed64c290d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,208,183,4,127,23,44,139,203,184,172,221,236,76,100,30,214,76,41,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
