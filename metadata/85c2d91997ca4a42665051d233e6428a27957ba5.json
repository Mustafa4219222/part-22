Musicians Reginald Arvizu, James Shaffer, and David Silveria wanted to continue, and recruited guitarist Brian Welch and started a new band called Creep.\n\nIn early 1993, the band took notice of vocalist Jonathan Davis after seeing his band Sexart and attempted to get him to join Creep. Davis initially did not want to join the band, but after consulting a psychic he decided to audition and then joined the band, as mentioned by Jonathan Davis himself in interview in the DVD Who Then Now?. The band soon changed their name to &quot;Korn&quot; (after Jonathan was recruited, they decided to get a new name. Jonathan suggested Korn as just a brainstorm, but everyone else enjoyed it.
