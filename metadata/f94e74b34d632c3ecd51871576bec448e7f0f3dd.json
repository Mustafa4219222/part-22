As SSIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swan song to the Forgotten Realms universe, these titles celebrate the elements of the AD&amp;D video games that you know and love - vast dungeons and beautiful locations to explore, a wide variety of monsters to slay, quests to complete, adventurers to assemble and worlds to be saved. These titles were a worthy conclusion to one of role-play gamingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most defining series and will be a fine addition your games collection. This final collection contains Dungeon Hack and Menzoberranzan\n\nEYE OF THE BEHOLDER\nA new evil is plaguing the city of Waterdeep, stalking the streets and preying on its citizens. Though initially thought to come from afar, this great evil, known only as Xanathar, instead resides within Waterdeep and, if not stopped, threatens to overwhelm the city. The Lords of Waterdeep believe that the evil lurks in the sewers below and have commissioned a party of adventurers to investigate and foil this nefarious plot. Granted full rights of marque and ownership of any treasure, artifacts or valuables you find on your quest, you must venture into the chasms, discover the nature of this evil and destroy it by any means necessary.\n\nDUNGEON HACK\nBuilt using the Eye of the Beholder engine, Dungeon Hack offers a randomly generated, RPG, Dungeon Crawler experience like no other. Explore countless new dungeons in a game that never has to be the same twice. Send your character on quest after quest, down through the many pits, traps, and puzzles that Dungeon Hack has to offer. This game delivers many combinations of play, a variety of magical and non-magical items to be found in each game and a bestiary stocked with over fifty formidable foes! For the more daring among you, Dungeon Hack also offers a Roguelike option, making death a far more definitive conclusion to your adventure.\n\nMENZOBERRANZAN\nWhile resting in Icewind Dale, members of your party have been captured by the evil Drow. To make matters worse, they have been taken underground, deep to where the Drow reign supreme. Descend and rescue your comrades, but be warned: Your fate and that of the famed Drizzt Do'Urden will become entangled - and your rescue mission will take on a whole new meaning!\n\nWelcome to the realm called Underdark and the malevolent city of Menzoberranzan. Prepare yourself for a role-playing epic unlike any you've ever experienced in the Forgotten Realms game world. New monsters abound. New tactics make combat more intense. The ability to levitate and fly add even more excitement to battles! The spectacular sights and sounds of the Menzoberranzan game are exhilarating.
