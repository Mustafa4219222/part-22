Peering behind the scenes, it provides a thorough analysis of the foundations of the present day industry for students and professionals alike: its history, its tools and processes, its markets and products. The authors, themselves close witnesses of the emergence of modern biotechnology from its very beginnings in the 1980s, clearly separate facts from fiction, looking behind the exaggerated claims made by start-up companies trying to attract investors. Essential reading for every student and junior researcher looking for a career in the biotech sector","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:111fe39febe36be68ec017826aa46a99dd2ebac1","amp;dn":"Concepts+in+Biotechnology+-+History%2C+Science+and+Business","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"111fe39febe36be68ec017826aa46a99dd2ebac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,31,227,159,235,227,107,230,142,192,23,130,106,164,106,153,221,46,186,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
