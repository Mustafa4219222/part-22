It was hosted by comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin and was broadcast over NBC. It originally aired as a one-time special on September 9, 1967 and was such a success that it was brought back as a series, replacing The Man from U.N.C.L.E. on Mondays at 8pm on NBC.\n\nThe title, Laugh-In, came out of events of the 1960s hippie culture, such as &quot;love-ins&quot; or &quot;be-ins.&quot; These were terms that were, in turn, derived from &quot;sit-ins,&quot; common in protests associated with civil rights and anti-war demonstrations of the time.\n\nThe show was characterized by a rapid-fire series of gags and sketches, many of which conveyed sexual innuendo or were politically charged. Rowan and Martin continued the exasperated straight man (Dan Rowan) and &quot;dumb&quot; guy (Dick Martin) act which they had established as nightclub comics.\n\nLaugh-In had its roots in the humor of vaudeville and burlesque, but its most direct influences were from the comedy of Olsen and Johnson (specifically, their free-form Broadway revue Hellzapoppin'), the innovative television works of Ernie Kovacs, and the topical satire of That Was The Week That Was.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aaed94809a8fcb457ce6fb35a3fb247498e3bc3","amp;dn":"Rowan+%26+Martins+Laugh+In+s01ep09+%2803-25-1968%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aaed94809a8fcb457ce6fb35a3fb247498e3bc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,174,217,72,9,168,252,180,87,206,111,179,90,63,178,71,73,142,59,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
