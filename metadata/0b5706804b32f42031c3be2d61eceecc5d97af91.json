ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a common clichÃƒÂ©, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d heard it often enough. People die or move away. Investments go south. Affairs end. Loved ones betray us...Stuff happens.\n\nDaisy McCraeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is in tatters. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lost her job, broken up with her boyfriend, and has been reduced to living in the attic above her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s store, the Union Street Bakery, while learning the business. Unfortunately, the bakery is in serious hardship. Making things worse is the constant feeling of not being a Ã¢â‚¬Å“realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ McCrae since she was adopted as a child and has a less-than-perfect relationship with her two sisters.\n\nThen a long-standing elderly customer passes away, and for some reason bequeaths Daisy a journal dating back to the 1850s, written by a slave girl named Susie. As she reads, Daisy learns more about her familyÃ¢â‚¬â€and her own heritageÃ¢â‚¬â€than she ever dreamed. Haunted by dreams of the young Susie, who beckons Daisy to Ã¢â‚¬Å“find her,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she is compelled to look further into the past of the town and her family.\n\nWhat she finds are the answers she has longed for her entire life, and a chance to begin again with the courage and desire she thought she lost for good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b5706804b32f42031c3be2d61eceecc5d97af91","amp;dn":"Union+Street+Bakery+-+Mary+Ellen+Taylor.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b5706804b32f42031c3be2d61eceecc5d97af91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,87,6,128,75,50,244,32,49,195,190,45,97,236,238,204,93,151,175,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
