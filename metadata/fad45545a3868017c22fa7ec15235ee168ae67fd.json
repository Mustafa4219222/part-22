Against great odds, he becomes a reporter and ventures to tell the story of his suffering and improbable recovery. He is shocked that millions globally remain sidelined by the same disease, many bedridden for decades.\r\n\r\nForgotten Plague is a journey into the hidden world of myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome).
