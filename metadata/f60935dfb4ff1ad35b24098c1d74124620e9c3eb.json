After offering a general overview on system complexity and maintenance politics and strategies it focuses on subjects such as neural networks, fuzzy logic, Markovâ€™s chains and processes, genetic algorithms and expert systems.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this study deals with the diagnostic aspects and safety level of technical plants (such as elevators and thermo-technical plants), and with the involvement of ad hoc designed software analysis tools based on neural networks and reliability indicators. It also explores the development of an &quot;intelligent&quot; maintenance management system has been developed, which allows distant monitoring and controlling by a remote control centre.\r\n\r\nMethodologies and Techniques for Advanced Maintenance is a useful resource for undergraduate students, university professors and researchers in engineering maintenance. Companies involved in maintenance and facilities, as well as those companies operating in industrial, plant and technological fields, will also appreciate the authorâ€™s informative approach to maintenance management, reliability and system complexity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f60935dfb4ff1ad35b24098c1d74124620e9c3eb","amp;dn":"Methodologies+and+Techniques+for+Advanced+Maintenance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f60935dfb4ff1ad35b24098c1d74124620e9c3eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,9,53,223,180,255,26,211,91,36,9,140,29,116,18,70,32,233,195,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
