The brash, energetic guitar might remind you of Edgar Winter Group, which would be entirely appropriate because guitarist Floyd Radford left this group to join that band just after this album was made. Edgar Winter himself has a cameo, playing a one-finger organ solo, and his longtime compatriot, Rick Derringer, produced the album. Interesting as it may be to pick through influences, Tin House had their own sound, composed of blues and progressive hard rock with poppy harmony vocals. The progressive side comes to the fore with the slightly pompous duo of &quot;Endamus Finallamus&quot; and &quot;Lady of the Silent Opera,&quot; which are redeemed by several catchy and inventive instrumental passages. Tin House was a hot band with some good ideas, and though the players went on to greater success in other groups, this album is worth a listen. \n\nTracklist:\n01.I Want Your Body\n02.30 Weight Blues\n03.Be Good and Be Kind\n04.You've Gone Too Far\n05.Silver Star\n06.Personal Gain\n07.Jezebel, Give Me Your Lovin'\n08.Tomorrow\n09.Endamus Finallamus\n10.Lady of the Silent Opera \n\nLineup:\nJeff Cole - Bass,Vocal\nMike Logan - Drums,Vocal\nFloyd Radford - Guitar,Vocal\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f537be986880cd523b97f154f79c59d26f6afc","amp;dn":"Tin+House+-+Tin+House+1971+%28Very+Good+Progressive+hardrock+blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f537be986880cd523b97f154f79c59d26f6afc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,245,55,190,152,104,128,205,82,59,151,241,84,247,156,89,210,111,106,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
