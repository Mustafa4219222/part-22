The title is a statement. This album is most assuredly jazz,\ndespite the presence of turntablists (DJ Axum appears for the second straight\nalbum, joined by Val Jeanty), occasional tangents into electronic downtempo, and\n21-year-old bassist Rashaan Carter's teaming with drummer Eric Allen to lay down\nsome of the thickest grooves this side of hip-hop. The bass doesn't walk all\nthat much (which isn't to say that Carter's debut is anything short of\noutstanding) and you won't find much swing-era swinging or obsessions with '60s\nbop. That's a good thing. Jazz is 21st century jazz by a weathered, seasoned,\nand credentialed 20-year vet. Unlike many contemporary musicians, Roney (the\nsame trumpeter faultily plagued by Miles Davis-clone assassinations) is not\nstuck in the past. Instead, he makes music that is an ode to the past, music one\nwouldn't mistake as straight-ahead jazz, although it does stare and venture\nstraight ahead. On &quot;Stand,&quot; Roney's reprise of the Sly Stone classic, Jeanty\nscratches in the chant &quot;break the rules.&quot; Jazz, however, sounds less like\nrebellion and more like invention. For the past three LPs -- Jazz, Prototype\n(2004), and Mystikal (2005) -- Roney and his trusted companions (pianist and\nwife Geri Allen, saxophonist and brother Antoine Roney) have collaborated to\nproduce music the opposite of static. There is nothing static about tunes like\nCarter's urban and brooding &quot;Fela's Shrine&quot; that begins with a world vibe and\nmorphs into street-corner jazz and Roney's &quot;Revolution: Resolution,&quot; which\ntravels through esoteric (in jazz terms) techno to the song's bellicose\ntheme. These are jazz songs that couldn't have been created until now,\ncontemporary in a fundamental (but not commercial) way. The older, purist crowd\nmay either scoff or trivialize this album, which is actually expected. Jazz\npoints to the new direction of jazz, and not everyone has to or will follow.\n~ Vincent Thomas, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a4c755dc3d7805f96a58ce0d127599b7ce0f3fe","amp;dn":"Wallace+Roney+-+Jazz+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a4c755dc3d7805f96a58ce0d127599b7ce0f3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,76,117,93,195,215,128,95,150,165,140,224,209,39,89,155,124,224,243,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
