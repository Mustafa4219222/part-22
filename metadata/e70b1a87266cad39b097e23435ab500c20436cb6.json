Ayres was quick to respond to European tachism and American abstract expressionism, creating a body of work that placed her in the forefront of her generation. In the sixties she was the only woman artist to be represented in the important 'Situation' exhibitions, showing large paintings combining oil and paint that aimed for the sublime using very radial drip and pour techniques of action painting. \n\nGillian Ayres defined her career by ranges of style and manner. In the sixties she created glamorous and decorative images in keeping with the hedonistic mood of that time. In the seventies Hans Hofmann inspired Ayres and returned back to an extreme and painterly extraction. Later in that decade Ayres moved back to oil painting and went on to develop her exclusive colourful style and has made an impressive mark on British art.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------\n[img]http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/7559/gillianayresscreen0mj1.th.jpg[/img] \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1840 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 26:24\nPart Size: 373MB\nSubtitles: NO\nRipped by: Dentje\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Further Information \n* Further Information\n\n2) Related Documentaries \n* Julian Opie\n* Chris Ofili\n* The Saatchi 100\n* Gary Hume\n\n3) ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Gillian_Ayres","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e70b1a87266cad39b097e23435ab500c20436cb6","amp;dn":"TheEYE.Gillian.Ayres.XviD.MP3.MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e70b1a87266cad39b097e23435ab500c20436cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,11,26,135,38,108,173,57,176,151,226,52,53,171,80,12,32,67,108,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
