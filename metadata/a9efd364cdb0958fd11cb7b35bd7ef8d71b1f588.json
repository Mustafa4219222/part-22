Housetrends is an idea that grew from a single magazine published in Dayton, Ohio into an ever expanding group of magazines in five markets. Launched in 2001, Dayton was quickly followed by Cincinnati, Ohio, Tampa Bay, Florida, Columbus, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Each city was chosen for its own unique sense of style and regional personality. Every Housetrends issue displays the vibrancy and creativity of the marketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s community of residents and home &amp; garden professionals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9efd364cdb0958fd11cb7b35bd7ef8d71b1f588","amp;dn":"Housetrends+Greater+Columbus+-+March+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9efd364cdb0958fd11cb7b35bd7ef8d71b1f588","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,239,211,100,205,176,149,143,209,28,183,179,91,215,239,141,113,177,245,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
