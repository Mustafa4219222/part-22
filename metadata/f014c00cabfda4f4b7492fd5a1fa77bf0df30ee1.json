Honda of Cibo Matto.  Recorded earlier this year, mostly at Sean LennonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s home studio in New York City, Come Home To Mama displays the passionate angst of her 2005 eponymous debut coupled with the twisted pop of 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s I Know Your Married But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Got Feelings Too.  Yuka and Martha have created an edgy, multi-instrumental soundscape that showcases MarthaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raw, confessional poetry with undeniable style and grace.  The captivating 10-song set features performances from Yuka Honda, Nels Cline (Wilco), Sean Lennon, Jim White (Dirty Three), Brad Albetta and Thomas Bartlett (Doveman).
