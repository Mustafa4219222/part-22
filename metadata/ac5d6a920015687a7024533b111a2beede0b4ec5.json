You may not (always) agree with him, you may not even like him, but you really should hear him. I have had the opportunity to hear a number of great thinkers of our era, and John is one of them - he brings a number of important issues to the table - issues that are important to the future of our planet (in other words, our survival). If you have a chance to see this film - I understand that it will eventually end up on PBS, but much better is the current tour with John and the maker of the film meeting with the audience - you should do so.\n\nJohn played an important role in the occupation of Alcatraz in 1969-71, a &quot;protest&quot; that up saved the Tribes - establishing self determination (of a sort) for American Indians - it caused Richard Nixon to return (with an apology) thousands of acres to Tribes that had been promised to them (then taken away).\n\nJohn is trying to save the planet - save us all - something we all should support and be working to do every day. We are all (potentially?) human beings and as such we should hear his words as they can inspire this goal, to our collective benefit. One of the most important films I have seen of late.\n\nMore related stuff: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/BhangWalla&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac5d6a920015687a7024533b111a2beede0b4ec5","amp;dn":"Trudell.2005.LiMiTED.DVDRip.XviD-LPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac5d6a920015687a7024533b111a2beede0b4ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,93,106,146,0,21,104,122,112,36,83,59,17,26,43,238,222,11,78,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
