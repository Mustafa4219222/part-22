Produced by Paul Ebersold, who masterminded their debut disc, the band adds swirling keyboard work from labelmates Sonia Dada's Chris Cameron, even utilizing steel guitar on a couple of tracks. As always, the loud'n'proud shouting vocals of singer Mike Farris is the centerpiece on tunes like&quot;Dragon Park,&quot; &quot;Boogie King,&quot; &quot;Groove Me,&quot; &quot;It Ain't Nothing&quot; and &quot;Halcyon Days.&quot; On a lighter musical note, the album closer &quot;Grace (Write Me)&quot; and the largely autobiographical &quot;Dandy Lion&quot; are the lyrical high points of this interesting record. A rousing, funky cover of Dr. John's &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot; is just the icing on the cake to a record that stylistically falls somewhere between the groups' two preceding albums, but one that simultaneously breaks new ground as well.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Big Wheel&quot;, released in 1998, contained &quot;Standing In The Sun&quot; and &quot;Boogie King&quot;, a rollick as at home in the mosh pit as it is cruising the local drag. In addition, &quot;Boogie King&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Bride of Chucky. Also, &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot; was featured on &quot;The Malcom in the Middle&quot; episode &quot;Home Alone 4&quot;, as well as &quot;Songs from Malcolm in the Middle&quot;, the soundtrack to the television series which was released on November 21, 2000.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdee555cf83abccbd7ed73715fe08e328188e45e","amp;dn":"Screamin+Cheetah+Wheelies+-+Big+Wheel+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdee555cf83abccbd7ed73715fe08e328188e45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,238,85,92,248,58,188,203,215,237,115,113,95,224,142,50,129,136,228,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
