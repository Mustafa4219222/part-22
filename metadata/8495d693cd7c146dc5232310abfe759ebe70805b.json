With their 2012 EP That Old Feeling A Rocket to the Moon has distanced themselves even further from their slick studio pop style for more rootsy tones. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a prevalent Hammond B3 organ grinding its way around the acoustic guitar strumming in a slightly countrified version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Whole Lotta You.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The following tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“Going OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ even includes what sounds like the twangy sounds of an old Telecaster guitar. But before you assume that Nick Santino and the guys have gone full country, listen closely Ã¢â‚¬â€ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still the same band playing the same hard-grooving guitar pop trimmed in catchy hooks. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve merely redressed these songs in a plaid western shirt with pearl snap-buttons. Ã¢â‚¬Å“First KissÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ still sounds like the softer side of A Rocket To The Moon. But with a weeping pedal steel seeping into the chorus and a Byrdsy 12-string guitar jangling through the verses, those amazing three-part harmonies now sound more like Rascal Flatts than Paramore. Anyone with an aversion to such change will dig the harder rocking closer Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re My Song.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8495d693cd7c146dc5232310abfe759ebe70805b","amp;dn":"A+Rocket+to+the+Moon+-+That+Old+Feeling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8495d693cd7c146dc5232310abfe759ebe70805b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,149,214,147,205,124,20,109,197,35,35,16,171,254,117,158,190,112,128,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
