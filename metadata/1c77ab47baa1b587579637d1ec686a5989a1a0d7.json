Check the file list for further information.\nIf you really, really like this stuff go and get you the CD.\nThe files are all, as usual, encoded using the ogg-vorbis encoder.\nI used the highest available quality level of encoding (10).\nYou may not be able to play ogg-vorbis files on ordinary mp3 players. If it doesn\\&amp;#039;t play it, either throw it away and get one of the Samsung Yepp series (for instance) or try to pimp it with a new firmware. Just a suggestion ...\nHave fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c77ab47baa1b587579637d1ec686a5989a1a0d7","amp;dn":"Anne+Clark+-+Wordprocessing+-+Remix+Album+1997+-+Ogg-Vorbis+Q10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c77ab47baa1b587579637d1ec686a5989a1a0d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,119,171,71,186,161,181,135,87,150,55,209,236,104,106,89,137,161,160,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
