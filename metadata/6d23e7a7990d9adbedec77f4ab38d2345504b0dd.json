The next one is The Winton 360 on the weekend of August 28th (I think)\nSo please help bring the Aussie V8's to the world\nP.S. Sundays Race (in this torrent) in particular Race 24 is definitely one of the most dramatic races ever. Enjoy!! And SEED HEAPS!!! \nIf you love V8 Supercars, or you just love motor Racing, you simply must try iRacing, the very best public simulator available. \nMany real world drivers use it for race prep, they don't just simply play it like you will find in other sims / games, many real world race drivers have written positive reviews about the physics being the best available. Mount Panorama is being released around Xmas, Montreal Canada has just been released and there's a large list of other tracks and cars with many more to come. So come join the iracing community. Its not easy it takes months to get good. Only catch is you will need a wheel like a Logitech G27 or better. you can use a Madcatz 2 (but they are crappy and break easily) many people spend thousands on home simulators using iRacing. just Google reviews for iracing and you will see. plus they have special %50 off deals for new sign ups. Its Awesome. Hope to see you there. www.iracing.com\nPLEASE SEED!!! Help Spread the V8 Supercars to the world, don't let people out of Australia suffer with the highlights broadcast.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d23e7a7990d9adbedec77f4ab38d2345504b0dd","amp;dn":"Australian+V8+Supercars+-+2013+-+Ipswitch+%5BSunday%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d23e7a7990d9adbedec77f4ab38d2345504b0dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,35,231,167,153,13,154,219,237,236,119,244,171,56,210,52,85,4,176,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
