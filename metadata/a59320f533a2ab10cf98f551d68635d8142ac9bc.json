The town elders held a tribunal and found Wyatt and his family guilty of mortal sin and cast their bodies into unholy ground for eternity...or did they?  \n\nWhen a young couple and their three children move into a mysterious apartment building, they soon begin to see apparitions of the long dead family of Robert Wyatt.  The secrets of the house--and dangers--are deepening with every passing hour as the young family struggles to escape the horrors surrounding them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a59320f533a2ab10cf98f551d68635d8142ac9bc","amp;dn":"Lot+13+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a59320f533a2ab10cf98f551d68635d8142ac9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,147,32,245,51,162,171,16,207,152,245,81,214,134,53,216,20,42,201,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
