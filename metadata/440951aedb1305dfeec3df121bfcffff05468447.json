Since then the color divide has become symbolic of a culture war that thrives on stereotypes--pickup-driving red-state Republicans who vote based on God, guns, and gays; and elitist blue-state Democrats woefully out of touch with heartland values. With wit and prodigious number crunching, Andrew Gelman debunks these and other political myths.\n\nThis expanded edition includes new data and easy-to-read graphics explaining the 2008 election. Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State is a must-read for anyone seeking to make sense of today's fractured political landscape.\n\n264 pages\nPublisher: Princeton University Press; Expanded edition (December 27, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0691143935\nISBN-13: 978-0691143934","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:440951aedb1305dfeec3df121bfcffff05468447","amp;dn":"Red+State%2C+Blue+State%2C+Rich+State%2C+Poor+State+by+A.+Gelman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"440951aedb1305dfeec3df121bfcffff05468447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,9,81,174,219,19,5,223,238,195,223,18,27,252,255,255,5,70,132,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
