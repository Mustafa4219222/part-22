It became their third consecutive album to top the UK chart.\n\nThe album shows a newly found maturity compared to the brazenness of the previous three. After this mature and soulful album they returned to the sound of their previous albums with their next album. The title can also be explained by this statement: they had to go here, and record this album, to come back and return to their old sound.\n\nReleased June 2, 2003 \nRecorded June 2001 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ February 2003 (at Real World Studios) \nGenre Rock\nBritpop \nLength 59:12 \nLabel V2 \nProducer Kelly Jones \n\n&quot;Help Me (She's Out of Her Mind)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:55 \n&quot;Maybe Tomorrow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \n&quot;Madame Helga&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55 \n&quot;You Stole My Money Honey&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18 \n&quot;Getaway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08 \n&quot;Climbing the Wall&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55 \n&quot;Jealousy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26 \n&quot;I'm Alright (You Gotta Go There to Come Back)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36 \n&quot;Nothing Precious at All&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 \n&quot;Rainbows and Pots of Gold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11 \n&quot;I Miss You Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50 \n&quot;High as the Ceiling&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:19 \n&quot;Since I Told You It's Over&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43 \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781e06c5d46d0b7aa256ee4107f56f5ce5ff94a1","amp;dn":"Stereophonics...You+Gotta+Go+There+to+Come+Back%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781e06c5d46d0b7aa256ee4107f56f5ce5ff94a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,30,6,197,212,109,11,122,162,86,238,65,7,245,111,92,229,255,148,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
