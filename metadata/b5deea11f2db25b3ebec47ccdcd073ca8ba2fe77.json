To date, Adero is the youngest solo R&amp;B artist to hit Chicago radio rotation in over 30 years. Indeed, this budding new artist has an impressive resume for his age. His name, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAderoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ properly fitting; means ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGive LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and he is ready to take the world by storm! With each live performance, Adero infuses his seemingly infinite energy. Nowhere is his exuberant outlook expressed better than when he sings and writes. He might be just a teen, but his musical ability shows experience, passion and wisdom coming from a place far beyond the date on his birth certificate. Referred to as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œboy wonderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s media press at an early age; you may notice this is not your ordinary newcomer. For one thing, this fresh-faced R&amp;B singer is still in high school.\n\nIn September 2010, AderoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new performance music video ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKnightCrawlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was selected by mFlix, an On-Demand mobile (telephone) channel on Sprint/Nextel, and is now available on mFlix video playlist, which airs 24/7 On Demand. AderoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music can also be heard at all Six Flags Theme Parks in the United States, Canada and Mexico as of August 2010.\n\nAdero has an increasingly strong viral, print and television presence. Adero made his first music video in 2005, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSave Some World for MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, which was selected by Swept Away TV, a nationally distributed teen music/pop culture TV show seen in 42 markets( including NYC, Philadelphia, Miami, Atlanta and Phoenix and is estimated to be available in 19 million households).
