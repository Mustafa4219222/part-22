Romero, starring Duane Jones, Judith O'Dea and Karl Hardman. It premiered on October 1, 1968, and was completed on a US$114,000 budget. The film became a financial success, grossing $12 million domestically and $18 million internationally. It has been a cult classic ever since. Night of the Living Dead was heavily criticized at its release owing to explicit content, but eventually garnered critical acclaim and has been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry as a film deemed &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.&quot; The film has entered the public domain due to an error by the distributor.\n\nThe story follows characters Ben (Duane Jones), Barbra (Judith O'Dea), and five others trapped in a rural farmhouse in Pennsylvania which is attacked by unnamed &quot;living dead&quot; monsters, drawing on earlier depictions in popular culture of zombies. Night of the Living Dead was the basis of five subsequent Living Dead films (1978Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2010) also directed by Romero, and has inspired remakes.\n\nCast\n\nDuane Jones as Ben\nJudith O'Dea as Barbra\nKarl Hardman as Harry Cooper\nMarilyn Eastman as Helen Cooper\nKeith Wayne as Tom\nJudith Ridley as Judy\nKyra Schon as Karen Cooper\nCharles Craig as Newscaster / Undead\nBill Hinzman as Cemetery Living Dead\nGeorge Kosana as Sheriff McClelland\nRussell Streiner as Johnny\nBill Cardille as WIIC-TV, Channel 11 news reporter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f685abf2e93d03a8d5e10ca9e3548faa403187d9","amp;dn":"Night+Of+The+Living+Dead%3A+30th+Anniversary+Edition+%7C+1968+%7C+DVDR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f685abf2e93d03a8d5e10ca9e3548faa403187d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,133,171,242,233,61,3,168,213,225,12,169,227,84,143,170,64,49,135,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
