Also like Star Trek - the Rocky Jones series also consistently cast women in positions of considerable power and responsibility - a bold move for 1950s TV. Like later series from the Star Trek franchise, the show also employs pseudo-scientific black-box technologies and technobabble quite liberally in order to avoid plot holes and speed bumps on the highway of logic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10a0855d2ef2e898f8e87768ba4f9440c5df8c2d","amp;dn":"Menace+From+Outer+Space+%281956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10a0855d2ef2e898f8e87768ba4f9440c5df8c2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,160,133,93,46,242,232,152,248,232,119,104,186,79,148,64,197,223,140,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
