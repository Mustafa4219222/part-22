You do not need a Pilates Circle to do the workout, but it does make it more challenging. The resistance of the Pilates Circle sculpts hard to tone areas, giving you beautifully defined arms, toned flat abs, a slim waist and hips, lean thighs, and a great rear! Pilates Circle Challenge begins with a calming stretch to ready your mind and body. Then you will work your entire core and lower body while engaging your upper body as well. You will end with a gentle stretch to improve flexibility. Running time: approximately 50 minutes Recommended equipment: a mat or carpeted surface; a Pilates Circle is recommended but not absolutely necessary. DVD includes three shorter options.\n\nVideo; x264; 708*480 (4:3); 2273 kbps; 29.970 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0808141683d248852bea167beeeb7790da3aaab8","amp;dn":"Pilates+Circle+Mat+Challenge+with+Bernadette+Giorgi+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0808141683d248852bea167beeeb7790da3aaab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,8,20,22,131,210,72,133,43,234,22,123,238,235,119,144,218,58,170,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
