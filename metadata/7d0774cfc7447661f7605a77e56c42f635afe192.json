Amritha (the bubbly Ramya) wants to live for the moment and Puru (the disconcertingly Aftab Shivdasani looking Dhyan) puts off pleasure for a later day. In the hands of a different director, this would have been the making of a terrible Hollywood-style romcom focusing on the worst Ã¢â‚¬Å“Men are from MarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ clichÃƒÂ©s. In Amrithadhare, however, director Nagathihalli Chandrashekhar creates a surprisingly un-clichÃƒÂ©d story Ã¢â‚¬â€œ helped along in no small part by the talents of Ramya Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and even manages a bit of a social conscience.\n\nThe other thread running through the film is the idea of a house versus a home. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been wondering where the social conscience of the popular Bollywood films of the 1970s has traveled to, look no further.
