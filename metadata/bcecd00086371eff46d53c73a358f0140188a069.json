This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nGeorge Michael is at number two with his song, &quot;I Want Your Sex.&quot; For as long as that song was in the countdown, Casey refused to say its title in his broadcast!\n\nMichael Jackson debuts on the hot 100 with his song, &quot;I Just CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Stop Loving You,&quot; all the way up at number 37.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;Which men have had the most top ten solo hits in the rock era?&quot; Casey lists the top three.\n\nThere's a singer in the countdown who, with her latest hit, ties Lionel Richie for most consecutive top 10 hits in the 80's. This lady hasn't missed the top 10 since her first hit in 1984, and had 13 as of August, 1987.\n\nOne song on the chart was inspired by a fight the songwriter had with his wife. When the wife heard the new song, she wanted equal say, wrote some lyrics and the song became a hit in this countdown.\n\nOne singer on the chart originally wanted to be a music teacher. As of 1987 she had over 50 hits, 31 top 40 hits, and five Grammys.\n\nAnother singer in this broadcast was asked to play a command performance for the Prince of Wales without ever having a hit song.\n\n40:    Didn't We Almost Have It All - Whitney Houston\n39:    Wipeout - The Fat Boys &amp; The Beach Boys\n38:    Funkytown - Pseudo Echo            \n37:    I Just Can't Stop Loving You - Michael Jackson\n36:    Mary's Prayer - Danny Wilson\n35:    Happy - Surface\n34:    Here I Go Again - Whitesnake\n33:    Since You've Been Gone - The Outfield\nLDD: Every Breath You Take Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Police\n32:    Give To Live - Sammy Hagar\n31:    Don't Disturb This Groove - The System\n30:    Point Of No Return - Expose\n29:    When Smokey Sings - ABC\n28:    Doing It All For My Baby - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n27:    Something So Strong - Crowded House\n26:    Hearts On Fire - Bryan Adams\n25:    Living In A Box - Living In A Box\n24:    Girls Girls Girls - Motley Crue\n23:    Can't We Try - Dan Hill With Vonda Shepard\n22:    I'd Still Say Yes - Klymaxx\n21:    Love Power - Dionne Warwick &amp; Jeffrey Osborne\n20:    Seven Wonders - Fleetwood Mac\n19:    It's Not Over ('Til It's Over) - Starship\n18:    Kiss Him Goodbye - The Nylons\n17:    I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) - Whitney Houston\n16:    Back In The High Life Again - Steve Winwood\n15:    The Pleasure Principle - Janet Jackson\nLDD: What Does It Take (To Win Your Love) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jr. Walker &amp; The All-Stars\n14:    Rock Steady - The Whispers\n13:    Only In My Dreams - Debbie Gibson\n12:    Don't Mean Nothing - Richard Marx\n11:    La Bamba - Los Lobos\n10:    Wot's In To Ya - Robbie Nevil\n9:    Alone - Heart\n8:    Cross My Broken Heart (From &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;) - The Jets\n7:    Who's That Girl - Madonna\n6:    Rhythm Is Gonna Get You - Gloria Estefan &amp; Miami Sound Machine\n5:    Luka - Suzanne Vega\n4:    Heart And Soul - T'pau    \n3:    Shakedown (From &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;) - Bob Seger\n2:    I Want Your Sex (From &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;) - George Michael\n1:    I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For - U2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcecd00086371eff46d53c73a358f0140188a069","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1987_August_8th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcecd00086371eff46d53c73a358f0140188a069","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,236,208,0,134,55,30,255,70,213,60,115,163,88,240,20,1,136,160,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
