The very name 'India' originated from the name of one of our greatest rivers, the 5indhu (Indus) - owing to the inability of the Persians to pronouce the sound '5'.\r\nRivers have always been our lifelines. Our great civilization took roots on their banks, the earliest known instance being the Indus Valley civilization that flourished centuries before the time of Christ.\r\nOn these riverbanks the ancient wisdom of sages blossomed, countless battles were fought and cultures of various colours fused. They witnessed the rise and fall of countless empires, and finally the birth of the largest democracy in the world.\r\nThis issue of Tell Me Why takes you to the world of India's great rivers.\r\n \nhttp://s17.postimg.org/vcb2gf6a7/Our_Rivers_Tell_Me_Why_108.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876dd72cd858a9eab8f5b2ccebeaf4a1cdb8cf22","amp;dn":"Our+Rivers+%28Tell+Me+Why+%23108%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876dd72cd858a9eab8f5b2ccebeaf4a1cdb8cf22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,109,215,44,216,88,169,234,184,245,178,204,235,234,244,161,205,184,207,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
