The scope of the \n\ncourse is vast, enabling you to prepare for the ground examination and practical \n\nflying test for the IMC Rating more thoroughly, effectively and enjoyably than is \n\npossible using traditional study methods. As a General Aviation pilot with a \n\ncurrent IMC Rating (IMC stands for Instrument Meteorological Conditions), you will \n\npossess the skills and qualification to fly your aircraft by sole reference to \n\ninstruments, and be qualified to fly in a wider range of meteorological conditions \n\nthan the pilot who holds just the basic PPL. For instance, outside controlled \n\nairspace, and in both Class D and E Airspace, the IMC Rating will permit you to \n\nfly out of sight of the surface, in cloud, and to take off in reduced visibility, \n\nand land from an Instrument Approach Procedure.\n\n\n\nNote: There is a Trick to Run this cd.(coz its copyrighted)\n\n1. Mount with your mouting software (deamon, virtual clone etc)\n2. Install (Dont RUN)\n3.
