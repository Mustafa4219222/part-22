For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway: This is a collection of Christian songs by the late, great Jim Reeves.\n\nWhen his wife Mary got sick from Alzheimer's disease,\nthe German company &quot;Bear Family&quot; got a real good deal when they\nconvinced her to sell them the rights to his music..\n\nI say that's immoral, and alone worth the effort to give this away freely to whosoever want to download it. Be Jim's guest.. :-)\n\nWhat many do not know, is that &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; in his concerts\nalways included a gospel section. The song &quot;Peace In The Valley&quot; is one example of this. He did this because he was a Christian.\n\nI do not know of any compilations like the one you've got here.\nI've called it: &quot;I'd Rather Have Jesus&quot;, because I think Jim Reeves really meant every word of every song he sung for Him.\n\nI truly hope you'll enjoy his soothing voice and humble, tender heart,\nthat they'll help you to maintain faith, hope and truth in the hard and turbulent time we presently live in.\n\nJesus will be back for us in His own time, and He'll gather the ones who wait eagerly for His return in the sky..\nThis world is not our home, we'll fly away..\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f086958299969982959d91999cb0979d91999cde939f9d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fad70015907662b2dc401de04efb5692faf3a3a","amp;dn":"Jim+Reeves+-+I%5C%27d+Rather+Have+Jesus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fad70015907662b2dc401de04efb5692faf3a3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,173,112,1,89,7,102,43,45,196,1,222,4,239,181,105,47,175,58,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
