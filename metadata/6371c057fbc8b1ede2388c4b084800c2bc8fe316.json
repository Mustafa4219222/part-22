That's the revelation in Arturo Sandoval's lush, strings-graced new album, &quot;A Time for Love,&quot; a dinner-jazz gem that could be the zenith of his 20-plus-year recording career. An Afro-Cuban bebopper at heart whose torrid trumpet runs have been his signature, Sandoval changes course here to deliver long-toned lyrical ballads with a string orchestral backdrop and a fine quartet. He interprets several standards, including the Mandel-Mercer beauty &quot;Emily&quot; and Cole Porter's classic &quot;Every Time We Say Goodbye&quot; (featuring a soulful accompaniment by pianist Kenny Barron). But what differentiates Sandoval's excursion into reflective, slow-song territory from most other orchestral jazz projects is his expanded repertoire scope. With help from vocalist Monica Mancini, he gently colors Argentine tango composer Astor Piazzolla's &quot;Oblivion&quot; and gorgeously delves into two classical pieces, one of them being Maurice Ravel's &quot;Pavane Pour Une Infante Defunte,&quot; originally composed for two hand-horns. To be faithful to the composer's vision, Sandoval enlists simpatico trumpeter Chris Botti--a smart move, given the latter's romanticism. --Dan Ouellette","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6371c057fbc8b1ede2388c4b084800c2bc8fe316","amp;dn":"Arturo+Sandoval+-+A+Time+for+Love+%5Bflac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6371c057fbc8b1ede2388c4b084800c2bc8fe316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,113,192,87,251,200,177,237,226,56,140,75,8,72,0,194,188,143,227,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
