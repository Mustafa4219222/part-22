Why? Because it's not perfect yet. It contains some poor quality IMAGE editions, which are not suitable for reading on the screen, they suck. Once I found the TEXT editions, this compilation will be the ULTIMATE one so far. The IMAGE versions are marked by (*). If you have one, several or all these e-books in their TEXT edition, please share them and let me know so that I can integrate the best torrent. Thanks for downloading!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ddf702a45c9bb5da6d0d2e54ead45d175b8d3f5","amp;dn":"O%27Reilly-Head+First+Collection+%2837+E-Books+with+Examples%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ddf702a45c9bb5da6d0d2e54ead45d175b8d3f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,223,112,42,69,201,187,93,166,208,210,229,78,173,69,209,117,184,211,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
