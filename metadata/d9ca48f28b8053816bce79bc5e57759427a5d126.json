This practical book teaches essential software development skills to help you automate and accomplish nearly any aspect of research in a physics-based field.\n\nWritten by two PhDs in nuclear engineering, this book includes practical examples drawn from a working knowledge of physics concepts. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to use the Python programming language to perform everything from collecting and analyzing data to building software and publishing your results.\n\nIn four parts, this book includes:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Getting Started: Jump into Python, the command line, data containers, functions, flow control and logic, and classes and objects\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Getting It Done: Learn about regular expressions, analysis and visualization, NumPy, storing data in files and HDF5, important data structures in physics, computing in parallel, and deploying software\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Getting It Right: Build pipelines and software, learn to use local and remote version control, and debug and test your code\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Getting It Out There: Document your code, process and publish your findings, and collaborate efficiently; dive into software licenses, ownership, and copyright procedures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9ca48f28b8053816bce79bc5e57759427a5d126","amp;dn":"Effective+Computation+in+Physics+-+Anthony+Scopatz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9ca48f28b8053816bce79bc5e57759427a5d126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,202,72,242,139,128,83,129,107,206,121,188,94,87,117,148,39,165,209,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
