Debates over the ethics of the death penalty aside, at the beginning of the game, James Earl Cash is presumably about to be put to death--and with good reason. Something happens, however. The &quot;lethal&quot; injection he's administered merely knocks him out. He later comes to and finds himself alone in a cell with an earpiece nearby. He puts it on, and this is how Cash meets Lionel Starkweather. Starkweather presents himself as Cash's savior and promises the man his freedom...after he performs a few key tasks. From this point on, Cash is thrust into a series of levels, called &quot;scenes&quot; in the game, during which he is hunted by ruthless thugs and must make use of any weapon he can find to dispatch of them--or else die trying. All this happens to Starkweather's great delight. You see, Starkweather makes &quot;snuff films&quot; and captures on video the bloody executions conducted by people like Cash. Cash, it seems, is Starkweather's latest leading man. The rather original storyline is very intriguing at first but doesn't really take off. As a result, it proceeds in predictable directions and essentially just acts as a setup for Cash so that he can be thrust from one hopeless situation into another\n\n\nviolent or bad language =18+ totally banned by GAME \n\nthis improve that Rockstar still is the best in sick violence. \n\nthx 2 all seeder on this site over 550 downloads ;-) \n\n-anarchy rips- 4u\nthis works with crack included within folder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd7d22a9179fe7c7a427e256f31e2f7f7a59ba64","amp;dn":"Manhunt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd7d22a9179fe7c7a427e256f31e2f7f7a59ba64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,125,34,169,23,159,231,199,164,39,226,86,243,30,47,127,122,89,186,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
