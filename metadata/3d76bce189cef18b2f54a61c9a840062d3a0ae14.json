He addresses death, and the reaper, repeatedly, as if it were a person. On the Bandcamp page for this self-released album, Mercer writes: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be beholden to anyone but that Ã¢â‚¬Ëœspirit forceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ within me that demands a constant production of music. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got to get the music out quicker, and being the owner of my music allows me to do this. Songs turn toxic within you if you leave them in there too long.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as if MercerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is music striving to become nature, as unchained as any guttural, animalistic thing inside us, eloquent and articulate in its way, always relevant and universal in its aspectÃ¢â‚¬â€music as a matter of survival. This is music that simply has to exist, simply must get out lest it stagnates, is overthought, turns against its writer. Music as FrankensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s monster, The Modern Prometheus. Mercer writes music the way a housecat hunts birds and insects: in fits and spurts of uncontainable instinct, despite a long line of domesticity.\n\n  Ultimately, Mercer has only done here what he seems always to strive to do, which is create an unflinching, uncompromising piece of art, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enough to recover, a little bit, the notion of giving oneself wholly and unreservedly and without embarrassment to the experience of art. Carey MercerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music rises above the excess, the desensitization, and the cynicism of cool that keeps us from developing empathy with the writer, with our fellow audience members, with critics. CareyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cold Spring reinvests some portion of me in the notion that music has meaning, and utility, and can makes things better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d76bce189cef18b2f54a61c9a840062d3a0ae14","amp;dn":"Frog+Eyes+-+Carey%27s+Cold+Spring+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d76bce189cef18b2f54a61c9a840062d3a0ae14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,118,188,225,137,206,241,139,47,84,166,28,154,132,0,98,211,160,174,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
