Recorded when he was just 22 years old, Facets illustrates the singer/songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earliest influences and hints at the talent that would later make him one of the most popular artists of his era. The new version of the album includes all the original songs, as well as seven rare bonus tracks hand-selected by wife Ingrid and son A.J. Croce, as a two-disc set, Facets and Jim &amp; Ingrid Too.&quot; \n\nThis contains all 18 tracks which can be burned as 2 separate disks or will all fit onto 1 disk as well. (Tracks 1 through 11 were originally on disk 1 and remaining 7 tracks were on disk 2.)\n\nI converted these from flac files for people who prefer dealing with mp3 files instead. They are ripped at 320kbps highest quality mp3.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nJediMaster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7010ec10532af47c1dd9badd9a6da4b8960838d","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+Facets+-+1966+%281st+Album%29+18+tracks+320+kbps+JediMaste","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7010ec10532af47c1dd9badd9a6da4b8960838d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,1,14,193,5,50,175,71,193,221,155,173,217,166,218,75,137,96,131,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
