Written by lordedmund\n\nFrom the award-winning team behind Smack the Pony comes Green Wing, the new comedy series that&amp;#039;s part soap opera, part drama - but all surreal and innovative. Set in a hospital, despite a general lack of medical attention, Green Wing follows new surgical registrar Dr Caroline Todd through her first day at work and beyond, starting out as she means to go on - dishevelled and under-deodorised having spent the night in her car. Among the bizarre cast of characters, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys - and what sort of Guy is Guy Secretan, the smooth talking anaesthetist?
