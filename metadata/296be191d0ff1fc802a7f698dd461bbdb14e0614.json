During an investigation, he is attacked by Gin and Vodka who belong to a syndicate known as the Black Organization. They force him to ingest an experimental poison called APTX 4869 to kill him without leaving evidence. A rare side-effect of the poison, however, transforms him into a child instead of killing him. Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa, Kudo hides his identity to investigate the Black Organization.\n\n\n(The first 3 episodes of Season 3 are included)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:296be191d0ff1fc802a7f698dd461bbdb14e0614","amp;dn":"Detective+Conan+%3A+Case+Closed+%28Season+1-2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"296be191d0ff1fc802a7f698dd461bbdb14e0614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,107,225,145,208,255,31,200,2,167,246,152,221,70,27,189,177,78,6,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
