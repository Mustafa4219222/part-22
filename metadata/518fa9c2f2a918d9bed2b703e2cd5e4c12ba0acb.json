On the chaotic set, she's aided by Zoe, the wardrobe mistress with a crush on her; she defends Vidal to a Parisian journalist who trashes all French film and praises John Woo and Schwarzenegger; she befriends Vidal when he goes over the edge; and, in costume, she breaks into a hotel suite to steal jewels as her victim talks on the phone. We also watch the making, the rushes, and the remains of Vidal's unfinished film.\n\nLanguages: French / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / French / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518fa9c2f2a918d9bed2b703e2cd5e4c12ba0acb","amp;dn":"Irma+Vep+1996+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518fa9c2f2a918d9bed2b703e2cd5e4c12ba0acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,143,169,194,242,169,24,217,190,210,183,3,226,205,94,76,18,186,10,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
