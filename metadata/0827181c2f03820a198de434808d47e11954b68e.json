At the Halloween party, they split up to find Jimmy in order to delete the text message. Meanwhile, Trish and Dez decide to go on a ghost-hunting mission since the mansion they are in is supposedly haunted. Luckily, they find Jimmy and Ally deletes the message by pretending to send a text to her father. Trish and Dez's ghost-hunting mission goes awry when they accidentally knock Taylor Swift unconscious. Since Ally is wearing the exact same costume as Taylor, she steps in and acts as Taylor Swift to not leave Austin hanging.\n\nSong featured: &quot;Don't Look Down&quot;\n\nNote: This is the first time Ally sings a duet with Austin onstage. \n\n\nOriginal airdate:  October 7, 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0827181c2f03820a198de434808d47e11954b68e","amp;dn":"Halloween.TV-Austin.and.Ally.S02E01.Costumes.and.Courage.HDTV.x2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0827181c2f03820a198de434808d47e11954b68e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,39,24,28,47,3,130,10,25,141,228,52,128,141,71,225,25,84,182,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
