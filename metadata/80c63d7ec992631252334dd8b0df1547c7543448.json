In some ways, Sable is poking fun at the superhero concept, as with the very amusing sequences of Jonathan trying to give himself super powers in a few familiar ways or the more ridiculous aspects of a boy who really, truly believes himself to be a superhero. However, there's a sincerity to Jonathan's belief in the superhero, and a certain nobility in his confidence in himself to be able to wear the costume or attempt to prove that he can fly, that is almost inspiring. While there are some superhero sequences in this book, the focus in the first issue of Grounded is on the real way that kids treat others who are different, whether it's playground age or high school age, and Sable does a really good job of conveying what it's like to be an outcast.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80c63d7ec992631252334dd8b0df1547c7543448","amp;dn":"Grounded+%231-6+%28BigBlue-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80c63d7ec992631252334dd8b0df1547c7543448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,198,61,126,201,146,99,18,82,51,77,216,176,223,21,71,199,84,52,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
