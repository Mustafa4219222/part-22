Fulford had been receiving serious death threats during this same time -- and so had I.\n \n    Ben asked me to post this I dont know what it is ,,\n    shall we take a look together ?\n \n    David,\n    Please post this link for people who want more evidence:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://upintelligence.multiply.com/?&amp;show_interstitial=1&amp;u=&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://upintelligence.multiply.com/?&amp;show_interstitial=1&amp;u=&lt;/a&gt;\n    Benjamin Fulford ÃƒÂ¥Ã‚ï¿½Ã‚Â¤ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â­Ã‚Â©ÃƒÂ©Ã‚ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ÃƒÂ£Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â£ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã…Â¸ÃƒÂ£Ã†â€™Ã‚Â³ 090-3439-5558\n\n    Comment by hutz the Vandalia Solution and World news click here on December 31, 2011 @ 10:29 am\n \n    wow\n    this is good stuff!\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://upintelligence.multiply.com/video/item/17&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://upintelligence.multiply.com/video/item/17&lt;/a&gt;\n \n    Comment by hutz the Vandalia Solution and World news click here on December 31, 2011 @ 11:32 am\n \n \nTHE SECOND TIME IN 24 HOURS -- BUT IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE COST\n\nI clicked on the link and could hardly believe my eyes. I had been told that it was potentially lethal to publish any images of these bonds, but this was the second time in 24 hours that I was looking at images that were nearly identical to what I'd received from Keenan.\n \nI had no idea that David and his eight-year-old son Mackie would burn to death in their home, just a week after he conveyed Ben's message to me, on January 6th. This may be the last known picture of them.\n \nAccelerants were found outside the residence, and arson was not ruled out.\n\n  \nI do not want their deaths to be in vain. This tragic event made it much more likely that these bonds are real, and that someone was blatantly warning me to call off this investigation.\n \nFear obviously did not deter me from publishing. Otherwise I'd have to live with being a coward, and potentially allowing this innocent father and son to have died for nothing. I would then have to deal with that pain for the rest of my life.\n \nEven if this was all somehow an elaborate hoax, involving a coordinated effort between multiple, seemingly independent players -- which I highly doubt -- whoever is playing this game and feeding Ben and me &quot;disinformation&quot; is willing to kill all of us.\n \nAnd that upsets me.\n \nGreatly.\n \n \nUNWANTED PUBLICITY BONDS COLLECTION\n \nHere are the most striking images that jumped out at me when I browsed through the various collections on the Unwanted Publicity Intelligence website.\n \nAgain, there are absolutely irrefutable, undeniable similarities to what we have just seen from Neil Keenan and Udo Pelkowski -- and what my own insider had described to me before I ever got to see a picture.\n \nIn particular, I found a chest issused by a different Federal Reserve bank -- this time in Dallas, Texas -- that was almost identical to the images of the 1934 series boxes that Neil Keenan had sent me.\n \nUnwanted Publicity also had more pictures of the bonds that were inside the boxes -- some of which looked quite outrageous, and were elaborate, detailed and sexy enough to be believable -- despite their seemingly astronomical denominations.\n--::--\n\n\nSo, this is the kind of information that people may have been killed for. Since it appears that the sites are note being maintained anymore, it seemed like a good idea to make a mirror of these.\n\nEnjoy, and please consider seeding to make sure this information does not dissapear...\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54543a23e27a524a4a4a58f5deb3b01c1b45eaed","amp;dn":"Unwanted_Publicity_Intelligence_Annex","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54543a23e27a524a4a4a58f5deb3b01c1b45eaed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,84,58,35,226,122,82,74,74,74,88,245,222,179,176,28,27,69,234,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
