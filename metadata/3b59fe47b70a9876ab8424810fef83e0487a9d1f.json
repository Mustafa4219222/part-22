It's an album of its time, in both\nKing's life and career, and the music of its era -- singer/songwriters were still\nsomething new, and in 1970, it was assumed that anyone in rock had to tend toward\nthe extrovert and flashy to attract attention. Thus, Writer has a somewhat louder\nsound than the relatively lean, introspective strains of Tapestry which followed.\n&quot;Spaceship Races,&quot; which opens the record, features Danny Kootch Kortchmar\nplaying full-out electric guitar, chopping and crunching away with his amp turned way\nup, and King belting out a number behind his bluesy licks that makes her sound like\nGrace Slick and the song come off like a pounding (and good) Jefferson Airplane\nnumber of the same era, with a great vocal hook at the end of the verses. &quot;No Easy\nWay Down,&quot; with its soulful instrumental and backing arrangement, calls to mind not\nonly her own &quot;Natural Woman&quot; as done by Aretha Franklin, but also (in terms of New\nYork white women belting out soul) Laura Nyro at her best, and it's also a great tune\nwith a killer performance by King, whose wailing voice is extraordinarily powerful\nhere. &quot;Child of Mine&quot; is the closest that the album gets to the voice that she found on\nTapestry, while &quot;Goin' Back&quot; gives a more personal and elegant take to a song that is\notherwise thoroughly identified with the Byrds; and &quot;To Love&quot; has King diving into\ncountry music, which she pulls off with exceptional grace, the song's title referring to a\nbeguilingly innocent and free-spirited chorus that, once heard, stays with you. Even\nthe least interesting of the songs here, &quot;What Have You Got to Lose,&quot; is unusual in\nthe context of King's overall work, with its heavy acoustic rhythm guitar, soaring\nbacking vocals, and King's bold near-falsetto on the choruses. And that's just Side\nOne of the original LP / Side Two opens a little more slackly with the beautiful,\nreflective, but slightly too languid &quot;Eventually,&quot; and the delightful &quot;Raspberry Jam,&quot;\nwhich offers a soaring guitar showcase for Kortchmar (whose playing intersects the\nsounds of Roger McGuinn and David Crosby off of the Byrds' &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;), and\na head-spinning, swirling organ from Ralph Schuckett weaving below and around\nKing's piano, plus one of King's most playful vocals on record. The album ends on a\nspecial high note, King's singer/songwriter-styled reinterpretation of &quot;Up on the Roof,&quot;\nwhich anticipates the sound she would perfect for Tapestry, emphasizing words and\ntheir feeling and meaning as much as music, and expressing herself principally\nthrough her voice and piano, moving the band out of the way. Ironically enough, if\nWriter had been released by almost any other artist, it would command a near-top\nrating and probably be a fondly remembered period cult item today; instead, for all of\nits merits, it must stand in the shadow of King's more accomplished and distinctive\nwork that followed -- but even slightly &quot;off-brand,&quot; under-developed Carole King music\nfrom 1970 is still worth hearing today.\n\n\n\n  01. &quot;Spaceship Races&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09\n  02. &quot;No Easy Way Down&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n  03. &quot;Child of Mine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n  04. &quot;Goin' Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n  05. &quot;To Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:39\n  06. &quot;What Have You Got to Lose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n  07. &quot;Eventually&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n  08. &quot;Raspberry Jam&quot; (King, Toni Stern) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n  09. &quot;Can't You Be Real&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n  10. &quot;I Can't Hear You No More&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n  11. &quot;Sweet Sweetheart&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n  12. &quot;Up on the Roof&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nCarole King - Piano, Vocals, Backing Vocals, &amp; Arrangements\nRalph Schuckett - Organ\nJohn Fischbach - Moog Synthesizer\nJames Taylor - Acoustic Guitar &amp; Backing Vocals\nDaniel Kortchmar - Acoustic Guitar, Electric Guitar, Conga\nCharles Larkey - Fender Bass\nJoel O'Brien - Drums, Percussion, Vibes\nAbigale Haness and Delores Hall - Backing Vocals\n\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b59fe47b70a9876ab8424810fef83e0487a9d1f","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Writer+1970+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b59fe47b70a9876ab8424810fef83e0487a9d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,89,254,71,183,10,152,118,171,132,36,129,15,239,131,224,72,122,157,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
