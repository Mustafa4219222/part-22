Other members included vocalist Peter French, guitarist Mick Halls, and the Brooks brothers Derek and Stu on guitar and bass respectively. The band's only album contained an acid guitar based psychedelic sludgefest of blues based rock. The band sounded like a raw combination of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.\n\nIt is worth noting that vocalist Peter French was later a member of progressive rockers Atomic Rooster, the power boogie band Cactus and the German band Randy Pie. He also unsuccessfully auditioned for Deep Purple after Ian Gillan left the band but David Coverdale was hired instead. This is a highly recommended reissue of powerhouse psychedelic blues based British rock. \n(J.E. Fell, amazon.com)\n\n- - -\n\nLeaf Hound - Growers Of Mushroom 1971\n(Repertoire Records 2005)\n\n 1.
