Organizations started to think about fundamental questions such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat is the\npurpose of having a website?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and considered how to build relevant content for their online presence.\nWith that, user experience improved. Then, when widespread broadband adoption began,\nthose organizations wanted to attract the huge audience that was now online, hence the reason\nfor the rapid growth in search-engine marketing that followed.\n\nNow, with businesses accepting the growing importance of their online presence, they are\nprepared to invest. But how much money and resources should an organization put into this? For\nexample, should the site cater to ten languages, accept five currencies, and run in four browser\ntypes from visitors with six different operating systems, including mobile? How should the site\nbe marketed, which channels are most effective, and can we predict the return on investment for\nthe next campaign?\n\nAnswering such questions requires data and hence a measurement tool. Put simply, this is\nwhat web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, allow you to doÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½study the online experience, in order to improve it.\n\nBut what can be measured, how accurate is this, and how can a business be benchmarked?\nIn other words, how do you measure success? Using best-practice principles I have gained as a\nprofessional practitioner, this book uses real-world examples that clearly demonstrate how to\nmanage Google Analytics. These include not only installation and configuration guides but also\nhow to turn data into information that enables you to understand your website visitorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience.\nWith this understanding, you can then build business action items to drive improvements in visitor acquisition (both online and offline), conversion rates, repeat visit rates, customer retention, and ultimately your bottom line.\n\nDescription:\n\nPart I Measuring Success\n * Chapter 1 Why Understanding Your Web Traffic Is Important to Your Business\n * Chapter 2 Available Methodologies and Their Accuracy\n * Chapter 3 Google Analytics Features, Benefits, and Limitations\n\nPart II Using Google Analytics Reports\n * Chapter 4 Using the Google Analytics Interface\n * Chapter 5 Reports Explained\n\nPart III Implementing Google Analytics\n * Chapter 6 Getting Up and Running with Google Analytics\n * Chapter 7 Advanced Implementation\n * Chapter 8 Best-Practices Configuration Guide\n * Chapter 9 Google Analytics Hacks\n\nPart IV Using Visitor Data to Drive Website Improvement\n * Chapter 10 Focusing on Key Performance Indicators\n * Chapter 11 Real-World Tasks\n * Chapter 12 Integrating Google Analytics with Third-Party Applications\n\nAppendix A Regular Expression Overview\n * Understanding the Fundamentals\n * Regex Examples\n\nAppendix B Useful Tools\n * Tools to Audit Your GATC Deployment\n * Firefox Add-ons\n * Desktop Helper Applications\n\nAppendix C Recommended Further Reading\n * Books on Web Analytics and Related Areas\n * Web Resources\n * Blog Roll for Web Analytics\n\nP.S:\nSecure torrent download: http://bayfiles.com/file/1jhL/toRn2F/Google_Analytic.torrent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42c0767da473dc5491d5121184b739e5a4a47d98","amp;dn":"Google+Analytic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42c0767da473dc5491d5121184b739e5a4a47d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,192,118,125,164,115,220,84,145,213,18,17,132,183,57,229,164,164,125,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
