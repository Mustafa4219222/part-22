The lightest touch of guitar strings hover and \n\nbalance on the murmur of a garden stream. Birdsongs beckon you closer as the gentle caress of the music awakens inner sences. Immersed in the natural \n\nsounds and music, you are purified, energized and delighted.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Butterfly World.flac \n2. Gateway to Nature.flac \n\nAll music composed, arranged, and performed by David Sun\n\n\\&quot;When mountain, meadow, wood and stream\nWith unalloying glory gleam,\nAnd to the spirit\\'s ear and eye\nare unison and harmony.\\&quot;\n\n\n\nCassette version\n\n \\&quot;The Secret Garden\\&quot; by David Sun, 1984 \n\nDescription\n\nAn imaginative and sensitive recording of free-floating acoustic guitar music that is enveloped in an ambience of nature sounds, ranging from birdsong \n\nto the soft patter of rain. Enter a wonderous and relaxing world of enchantment...\n\nTracklist:\n1. Side A.wma\n2. Side B.wma\n\nCover artwork for both CD and cassette by Danny Flynn.\n\n\nNOTE: Although it\\'s the same type of mediative, ambient music sharing the same title and artwork for both versions, the tracks are completely different \n\non each. Obviously that\\'s the reason I included both in the torrent. The quality of the Cassette version naturally is worse than that of the CD\\'s. I \n\nused microsoft\\'s sound recorder to copy it to my PC. But I guarantee the listening experience will pretty much be the same and maybe even better! That \n\nold cassette was the reason I bought the CD after all. But it wasn\\'t the same.. Anyways! \nHappy listening! \n\nRain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df47ca4cc5d4f6a47786952b0a7a6690b8748e2","amp;dn":"David+Sun+-+The+Secret+Garden+%28+FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df47ca4cc5d4f6a47786952b0a7a6690b8748e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,244,124,164,204,93,79,106,71,120,105,82,176,167,166,105,11,135,72,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
