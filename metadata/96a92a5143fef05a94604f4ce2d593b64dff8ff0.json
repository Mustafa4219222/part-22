Building on this technology, MOFs could increase this capacity even furtherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to the point where fuel-cell-powered cars can one day become a reality.\n\nThe first, and definitive, reference on MOF chemistry, Metal-Organic Frameworks looks at the scientific possibilities inherent in these crystalline compounds with an in-depth view of how their chemical properties enable them to maximize surface areas with scaffolds made up of linked rods. Metal-Organic Frameworks covers the essential MOF fundamentals and discusses their key benefits, such as how they can be made with simple and low-cost building units to afford technologically advanced molecular and supramolecular materials. This book:\n\n    * Uncovers rational design strategies, particularly in connection with self-assembly and supramolecular chemistry\n    * Describes pore surface engineering and decoration\n    * Outlines emerging applications to separations and gas storage\n    * Discusses how the fields of nanotechnology and green chemistry are contributing to MOF studies\n\nMetal-Organic Frameworks collects input from leading authorities in MOF chemistry and details important and timely contributions. Comprehensive coverage offers the reader a thorough and reliable view of the groundbreaking discoveries and forward-thinking research defining how far this field has comeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how far it still has to go. Suitable to gain an advanced-level understanding in this area, this book also serves as a valuable teaching tool, making it an ideal addition to the classroom.\n\n.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 368 pages\n    * Publisher: Wiley; 1 edition (August 9, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0470195568\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0470195567","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96a92a5143fef05a94604f4ce2d593b64dff8ff0","amp;dn":"Metal-Organic+Frameworks%3ADesign+and+Application+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96a92a5143fef05a94604f4ce2d593b64dff8ff0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,169,42,81,67,254,240,90,148,96,79,76,226,213,147,182,77,255,143,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
