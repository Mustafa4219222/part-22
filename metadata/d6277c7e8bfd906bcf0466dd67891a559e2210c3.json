Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's &quot;precious&quot; ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities... \n\nThere is a little shutter for the first few minutes but it's the best copy out so far.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6277c7e8bfd906bcf0466dd67891a559e2210c3","amp;dn":"The.Hobbit.2012.DVDScr-Pjones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6277c7e8bfd906bcf0466dd67891a559e2210c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,39,124,126,139,253,144,107,207,4,102,221,103,137,26,85,158,34,16,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
