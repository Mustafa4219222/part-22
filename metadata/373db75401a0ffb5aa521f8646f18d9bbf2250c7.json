Beautifully shot, this riveting first-hand testimony is interwoven with visually stunning archive material which has been re-mastered from the original NASA film footage - much of it never used before. \n\n\n\n\nDirected by: David Sington\n==========================\n\n\nProduced by: Duncan Copp\n========================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    In The Shadow Of The Moon\nYear.................:    2007\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:39:36\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    110 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    576x320\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    985 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    2 (External English + Hearing Impaired)\nFile Size:...........:    701 MB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2 November 2007 \n\n\n\n\n\n   \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925248/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0925248/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at \nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:373db75401a0ffb5aa521f8646f18d9bbf2250c7","amp;dn":"In+The+Shadow+Of+The+Moon-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"373db75401a0ffb5aa521f8646f18d9bbf2250c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,61,183,84,1,160,255,181,170,82,31,134,70,241,141,155,191,34,80,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
