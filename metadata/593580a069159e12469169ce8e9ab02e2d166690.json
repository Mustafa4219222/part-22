His real-life Alfred, a man who served as his publicist and assistant for 10 years, tells the inside story of the reclusive star.

Six months later, a recording of Bale's four-minute rant on the set of Terminator Salvation was leaked and the star's irritability began to define him. But beyond his notorious temper, Bale, an Academy Award-winning actor for his role in &quot;The Fighter&quot;, is known for his ability to physically transform himself for roles in &quot;American Psycho&quot;, &quot;The Machinist&quot;, and as one of Hollywood's most revered and bankable characters - the quintessentially American anti-hero, Batman. In &quot;Christian Bale: The Inside Story of the Darkest Batman&quot;, Bale's former publicist and assistant Harrison Cheung - his real-life Alfred - shares an inside look into the little-known personal life of the intensely private and reclusive actor.\n...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Christian-Bale-Harrison-Cheung/dp/1936661640&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Christian-Bale-Harrison-Cheung/dp/1936661640&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593580a069159e12469169ce8e9ab02e2d166690","amp;dn":"Christian+Bale+-+The+Inside+Story+of+the+Darkest+Batman.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593580a069159e12469169ce8e9ab02e2d166690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,53,128,160,105,21,158,18,70,145,105,206,142,154,176,46,45,22,102,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
