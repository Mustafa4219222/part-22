Cover art by Ward.\nStill rooming at his college fraternity house, he received a call from Pratt regarding another job, assisting comic book artist Jack Binder. He joined Binder's small art studio, a &quot;packager&quot; that supplied outsourced comics pages to fledgling comic-book publishers, where Pete Riss was an assistant. The studio was relocating from The Bronx to Ridgewood, New Jersey at the time, to the upstairs loft of a barn; there, Binder drew layouts for Fawcett Comics stories, for which Riss penciled and inked figures and Ward drew the backgrounds. Features included &quot;Mister Scarlet and Pinky&quot;, &quot;Bulletman&quot;, &quot;Ibis the Invincible&quot;, &quot;Captain Battle&quot;, the &quot;Black Owl&quot;, and the adapted pulp magazine features &quot;Doc Savage&quot; and &quot;The Shadow&quot;. The studio grew to approximately 30 artists, with Ken Bald as art director.\nWard's first credited works are writing and drawing an episode each of the two-page humor feature &quot;Private Ward&quot; in Fawcett's Spy Smasher #2 (Winter 1941) and Bulletman #3 (January 14, 1942), published closely to each other.\nShortly thereafter, Quality Comics editor George Brenner hired Ward to write and pencil the hit World War II aviator feature &quot;Blackhawk&quot;; Ward confirmably did Military Comics #30-31 (JulyÃ¢â‚¬â€œAugust 1944), with the next several issues generally but unconfirmably credited to Al Bryant.[2]\nTorchy[edit]\nTorchy made her comic-book debut as star of a backup feature in Quality Comics' Doll Man #8 (Spring 1946), and continued in all but three issues through #28 (May 1950), as well as in Modern Comics #53-89 (September 1946 - September 1949). A solo series, Torchy, ran six issues (November 1949 - September 1950).\nSeveral Torchy stories, including some Fort Hamilton strips, were reprinted in Innovation Comics' 100-page, squarebound comic book Bill Ward's Torchy, The Blonde Bombshell #1 (January 1992). Others have been reprinted in fy Pages #1 (1987); AC Comics anthology Good Girl Art Quarterly #1 (Summer 1990), #10 (Fall 1992), #11 (Winter 1993), and #14 (Winter 1994), and in AC's America's Greatest Comics #5 (circa 2003). Comic Images released a set of Torchy trading cards in 1994.[3]\nWard drew an original cover featuring Torchy for Robert M. Overstreet's annual book The Comic Book Price Guide (#8, 1978).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05398ba0bcd905bffc03a5ee913c6a1023467c64","amp;dn":"Torchy+Sampler++Introduction+to+Bill+Ward%3A+King+of+Good+Girl+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05398ba0bcd905bffc03a5ee913c6a1023467c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,57,139,160,188,217,5,191,252,3,165,238,145,60,106,16,35,70,124,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
