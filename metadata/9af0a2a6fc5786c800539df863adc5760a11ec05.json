The four have boiled down their disparate sounds to create the ONLY sound: RED FANG.\n\nTour to Live.\n\n\n&quot;Melodic yet pummeling&quot;\n\n&quot;Urgent and a little horrifying&quot;\n\n&quot;Stoner-rock grooves atop Hot Snakes-like slithering guitar attacks.&quot;\n\nI canÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t get enough of the rough mixes of new material from PortlandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Red Fang. Threatening to rupture eardrums with unyielding, angular guitars, Red Fang nevertheless wields the multi-ton low end that seduced fans of Big Business.\n-- The Stranger\n\nRed Fang push SST sludge and Thor's hammer riffage through big filthy Sunn amps, and slay Sabbath's rhythm section using the jawbone of Greg Ginn. The result? Big gigantic rock that is easy to listen to (not easy listening, mind you)ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ It just makes sense, sounds good, and qualifies the simultaneous usage of both the thinking and the banging head, which are usually mutually exclusive.\n--The Portland Mercury\n\nThese guys are raw, occasionally distorted, and loud as fuck; they've opened for the Sword, the Saviours, the Fucking Champs, and the Melvins, and they've got a distinct brand of metal ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ shreddin', but with a groove ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ that's formidable on disc but absolutely kills live. I'd impart some kind of face-melting warning here, but a face melt by the Fang ain't something you wanna miss.\n--The San Francisco Bay Guardian\n\nDuring a recent string of dates on the East Coast with metal technicians The Fucking Champs, PortlandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Red Fang must have seemed like barbarian invaders by comparison. In place of symmetry and precision, Red Fang smears roughhewn, ragged riffs that place the band much more in the camp of Big Business (or even The Sword minus the hobbit shtick). Out behind a new five-song tour EP, the band sports members from all over the place, including Last of the Juanitas, Facedowninshit, and even the legendary San Diego noise collective Trumans Water.\n--The Onion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9af0a2a6fc5786c800539df863adc5760a11ec05","amp;dn":"Red+Fang+-+Tour+EP+2+-+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9af0a2a6fc5786c800539df863adc5760a11ec05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,240,162,166,252,87,134,200,0,83,157,248,99,173,197,118,10,17,236,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
