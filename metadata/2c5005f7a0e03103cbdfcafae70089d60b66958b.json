The Olympic had a successful career as a liner until she was broken up in 1935, but the Britannic met with a fate nearly as unlucky as that of the Titanic. Serving as a hospital ship in the Aegean, it was either torpedoed or the victim of a mine on November 21, 1916, and sank within an hour. Thirty out of its crew died. Robert Ballard will search for the wreck of the Britannic and explore the evidence surrounding its dramatic end.\nOriginal broadcast date: 01/28/97\n\n\t\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 708x480 (4:3), 29.97f/s,  1,417 Kb/s\nAudio: AAC 48000Hz stereo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c5005f7a0e03103cbdfcafae70089d60b66958b","amp;dn":"PBS+Nova+-+Titanic%5C%27s+Lost+Sister+%281997%29+VHSrip+Britannic.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c5005f7a0e03103cbdfcafae70089d60b66958b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,80,5,247,160,224,49,3,203,223,202,250,231,0,137,214,11,102,149,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
