The listener learns that when they become enraged and upset by difficult people, they are letting these difficult people upset them. The ABCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) are reviewed. The activating event (A) being the difficult person, and unhealthy emotional consequence (C) being intense anger or sadness. Dr. Ellis explains that the C is the listenerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own problem (not the difficult personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s) because it stems from irrational beliefs (B). Demanding that difficult people must not be the way they are, and it is awful that they are this way lead the listener to feeling angry. In addition, the listener learns how to dispute their irrational beliefs, and unconditionally accept the difficult person as a fallible human.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a442360eaa956b8e38dd3cec4e65fa7a29427a55","amp;dn":"How+to+Deal+with+Difficult+People+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a442360eaa956b8e38dd3cec4e65fa7a29427a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,66,54,14,170,149,107,142,56,221,60,236,78,101,250,122,41,66,122,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
