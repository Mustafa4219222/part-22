The stories\ninclude: &quot;My Robot Baby,&quot; in which a couple (played \nby Tamlyn Tomita and James Saito) must care for a \nrobot baby before adopting a human child; &quot;The Robot\nFixer,&quot; in which a mother (Wai Ching Ho) tries to \nconnect with her dying son by completing his toy \nrobot collection; &quot;Machine Love,&quot; in which an office\nworker android (Greg Pak) learns that he, too, needs\nlove; and &quot;Clay,&quot; in which an old sculptor (Sab \nShimono) must choose between natural death and \ndigital immortality.\n\nNotes: Found this in an old box of VHS's. Tape was\nkinda beat up. Interesting story, if you dont mind a\nVHS Rip. Video DOES contain white jaggies on top, but\ncropping them would have removed too much video.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c69edd5e721b9cda5b5fbbacbd12bbd10c41a47","amp;dn":"Robot.Stories.WS.VHSRip.XviD-AMiGOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c69edd5e721b9cda5b5fbbacbd12bbd10c41a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,105,237,213,231,33,185,205,165,181,251,186,203,209,43,189,16,196,26,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
