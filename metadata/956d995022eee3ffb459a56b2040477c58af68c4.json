You've heard part of my story, but it turns out there's more. My little girl, Kylie, is all grown up. Seventeen, beautiful, and talented, just like her mother. And just like Nell, my daughter seems to have fallen for a bad boy, one with a lot of darkness and a lot of secrets.\n\n*  *  *\n\nYou thought you knew the whole story. You thought it was over. Happily ever after for everyone.\n\nYou were wrong. \n\nMy name is Oz Hyde, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never met me.
