He is best known today for his voluminous publication of organ works, several of them still in the regular repertoire, but his classical works for orchestra deserve attention, as well. They were too studied for the pops, too musically advanced for the conservative academics. A lonely figure, he drew strength from the depth of his personal relationships, at home and at work.\r\n\r\nTournemire's Third Symphony was subtitled Moscou, and finished in 1913. It has nothing tgo do with Moscow, but instead, with the fact that at one time, hundreds of years ago, Moscow was known in some quarters as the City of the Bells because of the cast iron bells played by its endless Russian Orthodox churches. Visitors as far back as the 15th century commented in their diaries about the amazing cacophony of bells, and it was this sound that Tournemire made central each in its own way to every movement in his symphony.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
