W. Cooke\r\n\r\nA call to arms for the growing movement of â€œConservatariansâ€â€”members of the right who are fiscally conservative but socially liberalâ€”and a fascinating look at conservatismâ€™s past and future. \r\n \r\nThere is an underserved movement budding among conservatives, in which fiscal responsibility, constitutional obedience, and controlled government spending remain crucial tenets, but issues like gay marriage and drug control are approached with a libertarian bent. \r\n \r\nIn The Conservatarian Manifesto, Charles C.W. Cooke engages with the data and the philosophy behind this movement, applauding conservatarianism as a force that can help Republicans mend the many ills that have plagued their party in recent years. Conservatarians are vexed by Republicansâ€™ failure to cut the size and scope of Washington D.C., but they are critical of some libertarians for their unacceptable positions on abortion, national defense, and immigration. They applaud conservativesâ€™ efforts to protect Second Amendment rightsâ€”efforts that have recently been wildly successfulâ€”but they see the War on Drugs as an unmitigated disaster that goes against everything conservatives ought to value. \r\n \r\nAll movements run the risk of stagnation, and of losing touch with the principles and values that made them successful in the first place. In this book, Charles Cooke shows the way back to a better and more honest conservatism that champions limited government, reality-based policy, and favor for the smallest minority of all: the individual","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8084490e5b0d811cf274cd73cec2bebaa77447","amp;dn":"The+Conservatarian+Manifesto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8084490e5b0d811cf274cd73cec2bebaa77447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,128,132,73,14,91,13,129,28,242,116,205,115,206,194,190,186,167,116,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
