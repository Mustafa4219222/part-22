Ether knows no barriers; everything springs from it and returns to it after death, and its flow is life itself Ã¢â‚¬â€ the life of the Ether Universe. For the intelligent dwellers of this world, ether is a source of power and pure energy, sometimes referred to as magic. They are born with this ability Ã¢â‚¬â€ using invisible currents of energy flows, they create armor, weapons and servants... Ether is the thread from which they weave their world.\n\nEnter the world of Etherlords as a champion of one of the four great magical races: the powerful Chaots, the brilliant Kinets, the empathetic Vitals, or the ruthless biomechanical Synthets. Create a powerful deck of cards to summon troops who will follow your every command: exploring the world, conquering territories, battling the minions of enemy lords and ferocious creatures unleashed by the disturbances in the flow of the Ether. Build forces, create spells, and engage in diplomacy. Collect essential resources to fuel your armies, upgrade and enhance your spell sets, and create powerful spell books for conducting duels in the best traditions of trading card gameplay.\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nGothic 3: Forsaken Gods Enhanced Edition\nSilent Hunter 2\nPolice Quest 1-2-3-4\nPrince of Persia 2008\nLionheart: Legacy of the Crusade\nBeyond Divinity\nStonekeep\nDeus Ex 2: Invisible War\nDriftmoon\nSilver\nRunaway series\nStill Life 2\nRunaway 1,2,3\nEador Master of the Broken\nA New Beginning - Final Cut\nThe Whispered World\nmyst masterpiece edition\ndreamfall series\nshogo\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nBioforge\nEdna &amp; Harvey: TB + HE\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f9e592a4ebd518a7c5a8f820e0f6d537bed1603","amp;dn":"Etherlords+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f9e592a4ebd518a7c5a8f820e0f6d537bed1603","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,158,89,42,78,189,81,138,124,90,143,130,14,15,109,83,123,237,22,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
