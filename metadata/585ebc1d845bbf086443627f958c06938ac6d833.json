In the film 3 sisters escape and venture to walk 1,500 miles back to their tribe. The title refers to a fenceline that stretches for thousands of miles and the girls follow it. The wonderful aborigine actor David Gulpilil (Walkabout) plays a scout that is tracking the girls and Kenneth Branaugh plays an officer that is in charge of the whole operation. I guess the main flaw in the film would be the middle where most of the walking takes place and the film really slows down but its not a major complaint. The 1,500 mile trek is expertly paced and the film is by no means dull. Rather, its fascinating! The real footage that we see at the end of the film is so powerful that the whole essence of what you have just watched becomes even more devastating. This is more than just an important film, its a documentation of an ugly and shameful part of Australian history. A must see!

The policies depicted in the movie were enforced by the Australian government, we are told, until 1970. Aboriginal children of mixed race were taken by force from their mothers and raised in training schools that would prepare them for lives as factory workers or domestic servants. More than a century after slavery was abolished in the Western world, a Western democracy was still practicing racism of the most cruel description.\n\nThe children's fathers were long gone--white construction workers or government employees who enjoyed sex with local aboriginal women and then moved on. But why could the mixed-race children not stay where they were? The offered explanations are equally vile. One is that a half-white child must be rescued from a black society. Another was that too many &quot;white genes&quot; would by their presumed superiority increase the power and ability of the aborigines to cause trouble by insisting on their rights. A third is that, by requiring the lighter-skinned children to marry each other, blackness could eventually be bred out of them. Of course it went without saying that the &quot;schools&quot; they were held in prepared them only for menial labor.

The girls all had such natural talent and to see it behind the set, it came from another point of view. I couldn't believe how alike Everlyn was to Molly, no wonder she fit perfectly. It's a bit disapointing that they didn't have much on the stolen generation, or the real girls' lives but it was all the same very well done. It was very moving and heartbreaking how after the scene they were still crying. It just shows how much the past is still painful but how strong these people are.

Three Aboriginal girls were stolen from their families by the Australian government near a rabbit fence on the edge of the Gibson desert in the 1930s. They were then taken to a mission 2400km to the south. Desperate and homesick, the three little girls escaped and embarked on the long walk home, along the rabbit fence.\n\nNot surprisingly, this real-life story about Molly Craig, her sister Daisy and their cousin, Gracie, attracted a famous Australian director, who wanted to translate it to the screen. Phil Noyce, of Newsfront, Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games fame, tells James Thomas: &quot;This film represents to me the greatest challenge I've ever undertaken.&quot;\n\nA scene from Rabbit-Proof FenceNoyce dropped out of a $220 million Hollywood movie project to come back to Australia to raise money for Rabbit-Proof Fence. He began a nationwide search for three young girls to play roles that would challenge the most experienced actors. He was looking for raw talent; the irony of taking three girls from the bush to the celluloid world was not lost on the director: &quot;I suppose, in one way, you could say, in a different time and context, I'm AO Neville (Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia), promising these young Aboriginal children a better life, asking them to do things against their instincts perhaps, because it's for their own good. But we do live in a slightly different world. These children are not being taken away from their culture, their families. Their families came with them to make the movie, and their families are going with them to promote the movie, so it is a slightly different context.&quot;[URL=http://sunday.ninemsn.com.au/sunday/cover_stories/article_980.asp]more...[/URL][/QUOTE]\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................590,716,928                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................42:55.000                \nFrame Count:....................................64375             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................608                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................448                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.357                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1633                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.240&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\n------my rips, of course-----\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
