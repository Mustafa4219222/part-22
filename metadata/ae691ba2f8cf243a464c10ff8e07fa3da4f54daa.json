One hundred thirteen years later, two backcountry guides are hired by a history professor and his journalist daughter to lead them into the abandoned mining town so that they can learn what happened. With them is a psychic, and a paranormal photographerÃ¢â‚¬â€as the town is rumored to be haunted. A party that tried to explore the town years ago was never heard from again. What this crew is about to discover is that twenty miles from civilization, with a blizzard bearing down, they are not alone, and the past is very much alive.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae691ba2f8cf243a464c10ff8e07fa3da4f54daa","amp;dn":"Abandon+-+Blake+Crouch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae691ba2f8cf243a464c10ff8e07fa3da4f54daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,105,27,162,248,207,36,58,70,76,16,255,142,7,250,61,164,245,77,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
