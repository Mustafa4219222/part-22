Dated from September 1996 to May 1997, the series was written by Christopher Hinz and illustrated by Tommy Lee Edwards. It was placed in the same universe as Hinz's Paratwa Saga, featured in his trilogy of novels consisting of Liege-Killer (1987), Ash Ock (1989) and The Paratwa (1991). Set in the mid 21st century, the world of Gemini Blood was one of increasing global chaos. The plot of the comic followed a group of four adventurers as they attempted to combat the Paratwa, a race of genetically engineered assassins who share a psychic bond between twins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4df7cafaf06b61da3359f3266f2ee86e95d5515","amp;dn":"Gemini+Blood+%23+1-9+%28Helix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4df7cafaf06b61da3359f3266f2ee86e95d5515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,223,124,175,175,6,182,29,163,53,159,50,102,242,238,134,233,93,85,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
