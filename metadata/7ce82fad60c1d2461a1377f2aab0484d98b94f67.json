This performance was a unique historical event as it included a grand finale featuring Manowar members past and present on stage as one powerful, heavy metal legion, as well as an epic set up with a 200-piece choir and orchestra. The majesty and emotion of this event and the overwhelming reaction of more than 25 000 fans in attendance serves as a fantastic example of the preeminence that Manowar embodies.\n\nAccompanying this spectacular concert, the Manowar Mega Fan Convention itself was something to marvel at. Thousands of fans from countries across the globe converged on Geiselwind, Germany for three days of Manowar festivities. After witnessing the devotion and commitment of Manowar's fans, it is obvious why the band attests to having &quot;the greatest fans in the world.&quot;\n\nTheir first headliner DVD recording, The Day The Earth Shook - The Absolute Power contains over 6 hours of footage, filmed in full 5.1 sound with 27 HD cameras and comes housed in a unique multiflap digipak with 12 page booklet.\n\nTracklist:\nDVD1\nMain part\n01.
