His superb guitar playing has never been more focused, and his singing shows a fervent shouter in full command. But Allison's songwriting has made giant strides as well, and ten of the 14 tracks aboard feature him as a co-writer as well. The production by Jim Gaines delivers a modern-sounding album that stays firmly in the blues tradition while giving full vent to Luther's penchant for blending soul, rock and funk grooves into his musical stew. There are really no duff tracks aboard, but special attention should be paid to the sloppy but right slide guitar-meets-rock &amp; roll groove of &quot;Low Down And Dirty,&quot; and Allison's incredibly hot minor key soloing (at full rock volume) on &quot;Drowning At The Bottom,&quot; an acoustic duet with his son Bernard on &quot;Playin' A Losing Game,&quot; and the grinding social commentary of &quot;Pain In The Streets.&quot; If Allison had made albums like this for Motown 20-some years ago, it would be very interesting to speculate on how the blues history books just might have been rewritten. ~ \n\nRecorded at 315 Beale Studios, Memphis, Tennessee and Woodstock Studios, Paris, France.\n\nPersonnel:\nLuther Allison (vocals, guitar); Bernard Allison (vocals, guitar); Marla Glen (harmonica); Andrew Love (tenor saxophone); Wayne Jackson (trumpet, trombone); Kurt Clayton, Mike Vlahakis, Rick Steff (electric piano); Darin James, Willie Hayes, Lloyd Anderson, Steve Potts (drums).\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. &quot;Low Down and Dirty&quot; (Allison) - 3:45\n2. &quot;You Can Run but You Can't Hide&quot; (Butterfield, Glover) - 3:32\n3. &quot;Living in the House of the Blues&quot; (Williams) - 5:32\n4. &quot;You Can, You Can&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 3:42\n5. &quot;Will It Ever Change?&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 5:09\n6. &quot;Just As I Am&quot; Allison, Carroll, Solberg) - 4:55\n7. &quot;There Comes a Time&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 4:12\n8. &quot;Drowning at the Bottom&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 3:54\n9. &quot;Playin' a Losin' Game&quot; (Allison, Allison) - 5:30\n10. &quot;It's a Blues Thing&quot; (Allison, Carroll, Solberg) - 5:40\n11. &quot;Cancel My Check&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 4:19\n12. &quot;Pain in the Streets&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 4:43\n13. &quot;You're Gonna Make Me Cry&quot; (Malone) - 6:13\n14. &quot;I'm Back&quot; (Allison, Solberg) - 4:12\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44da04f803f40f061db44047199dfacfbe01c013","amp;dn":"Luther+Allison++Reckless%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44da04f803f40f061db44047199dfacfbe01c013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,218,4,248,3,244,15,6,29,180,64,71,25,157,250,207,190,1,192,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
