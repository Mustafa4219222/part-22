The Spook's Curse (2005)\n\nNow it's the dark's turn to be afraid\n\nThe Spook and his apprentice, Thomas Ward, deal with the dark. Together they rid the county of witches, ghosts, and boggarts. But now there's some unfinished business to attend to in Priestown. Deep in the catacombs of the cathedral lurks a creature the Spook has never been able to defeat; a force so evil that the whole county is in danger of being corrupted by its powers. The Bane!\n\nAs Thomas and the Spook prepare for the battle of their lives, it becomes clear that the Bane isn't their only enemy. The Quisitor has arrived, searching for those who meddle with the dark so he can imprison them or worse.\n\nCan Thomas defeat the Bane on his own? Is his friend Alice guilty of witchcraft? And will the Spook be able to escape the Quisitor's clutches?\n\nPerformed by Christopher Evan Welch","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:febf953bdf5bffe61ad8c3e0ba2ef04c321a34b5","amp;dn":"The+Last+Apprentice%3A+Curse+of+the+Bane+by+Joseph+Delaney","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"febf953bdf5bffe61ad8c3e0ba2ef04c321a34b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,191,149,59,223,91,255,230,26,216,195,224,186,46,240,76,50,26,52,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
