At its heart is one  \n  of the most famous scientists in the world, Bill Hamilton, who        \n  argued that human behaviour is really guided by codes buried deep     \n  within us. This was later popularised by Richard Dawkins as &quot;the      \n  selfish gene&quot; and said that individual human beings are really just   \n  machines whose only job is to make sure the codes are passed on. The  \n  episode begins in 2000 in the jungles of the Congo and Rwanda.        \n                                                                        \n  Hamilton is there to help prove his dark theories. But all around     \n  him the Congo is being torn apart by &quot;Africas First World War&quot;. The  \n  film interweaves the two stories  the strange roots of Hamiltons    \n  theories, and the history of the Wests tortured relationship with    \n  the Congo over the past 100 years.                                    \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Watched_Over_by_Machines_of_Loving_&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                                                        \n  Grace_%28television_documentary_series%29                             \n                                                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011lvb9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011lvb9&lt;/a&gt;                              \n                                                                        \n \n\n  WE'RE LOOKiNG FOR \n                                                   \n                                                                        \n  * Broadcast/Network/PPV TV Cappers with English PDTV/HDTV sources     \n     located in the US/UK/AU/CA/EU                                      \n  * People with PDTV/HDTV sources with an interest in capping           \n  * Pre-retail/unreleased DVD Suppliers (especially sports)             \n  * 100mbit+ affil sites with archives                                  \n                                                                        \n   Find us or email &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;84f3b0e2e7f6e1f3c4e3e9e5ede8aae7ebe9&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; if you can help                   \n                                                                        \n \n\n  GREETZ \n                                                              \n                                                                        \n   To all W4F/CLASSiCW4F members, both past and present. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b7ec59ef3ae047e5cf8e344e74d6fd303bf2bf0","amp;dn":"All.Watched.Over.By.Machines.Of.Loving.Grace.Part3.WS.PDTV.XviD-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b7ec59ef3ae047e5cf8e344e74d6fd303bf2bf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,126,197,158,243,174,4,126,92,248,227,68,231,77,111,211,3,191,43,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
