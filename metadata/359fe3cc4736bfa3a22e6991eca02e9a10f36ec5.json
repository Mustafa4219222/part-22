The band was formed by Kat Bjelland (lead vocals and guitar), with Lori Barbero (drums) and Michelle Leon (bass), who was later replaced by Maureen Herman in 1992. Courtney Love Ã¢â‚¬â€ a close friend and former bandmate of Bjelland when the two lived in Portland and San Francisco Ã¢â‚¬â€ had a very brief stint in the band in 1987 as a bass player, before being kicked out and forming Hole in 1989. Between 1989 and 1995, Babes in Toyland released three studio albums; &quot;Spanking Machine&quot; (1989), the commercially successful &quot;Fontanelle&quot; (1992), and &quot;Nemesisters&quot; (1995), before becoming inactive in 1997 and eventually disbanding in 2001\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:359fe3cc4736bfa3a22e6991eca02e9a10f36ec5","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+406","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"359fe3cc4736bfa3a22e6991eca02e9a10f36ec5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,159,227,204,71,54,191,163,162,46,105,145,236,160,46,154,16,243,110,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
