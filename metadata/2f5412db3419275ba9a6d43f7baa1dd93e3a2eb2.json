A MESSAGE TO ALL YOU HATERS: you're boring. \n\nDon't want to listen to Christian music? Then just piss off. I don't care what you think, I don't care what deiphobic crap you wanna type. I'm not trying to &quot;convert&quot; anyone and I'm also NOT CATHOLIC. I don't know any kiddy-fiddling priests and I think the pope's a dick. For argument's sake, say there is a Hell: the pope's going there.\n\nI'm just sharing some of the better music (and some filler material too I'm afraid) from our God-bothering gatherings of notes.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo anyway...\n\nThis is almost all of my Christian music from Skillet and Gen to Iona and 100 Portraits. There's not enough decent Christian music on the web because my brothers and sisters often don't believe in torrenting. :-P\n\nso the bands here are\n\n100 Portraits\nEnter the Worship Circle (100 Portraits and Waterdeep)\nThe Benjamin Gate\nBlindside\nCathy Burton\nCeltic Worship Band\nDay if fire\nDC Talk\nDownhere\nEowyn\nFirefly\nFono\nGen\nIona\n\nnChant (I met these guys at Greenbelt festival in the UK and we do the token &quot;goth&quot; eucharist. Come say hi)\n\nPhatfish (previously only the newer stuff... that mostly sucked but now I have &quot;Purple through the Fishtank&quot; and &quot;Unplugged: Hope&quot; back so enjoy. These albums are among my favorites)\n\nPillar\nPlum\nSanctum (something Firefly was involved in but never released)\nSja Worship\nSkillet\nThird Day\nVineyard\nThe Violet Burning\n\nI don\\'t have complete band discographies and I\\'m missing a few albums due to a headcase (like Phatfish\\'s decent stuff), and some of these tracks sck, but there\\'s good in each of these bands.\n\nEnjoy\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f5412db3419275ba9a6d43f7baa1dd93e3a2eb2","amp;dn":"decent+Christian+music+%5Bimproved%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f5412db3419275ba9a6d43f7baa1dd93e3a2eb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,84,18,219,52,25,39,91,169,166,212,63,123,170,29,217,62,58,46,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
