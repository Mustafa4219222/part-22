Alex's guest for approximately the last hour and a half of the broadcast is phamacist Ben Fuchs. Even Alex calls it &quot;infomercial-ing.&quot;\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec51b6e58d6f39774f2aed47bf260dd65b550236","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2013+Jan+25+FR+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec51b6e58d6f39774f2aed47bf260dd65b550236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,81,182,229,141,111,57,119,79,42,237,71,191,38,13,214,91,85,2,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
