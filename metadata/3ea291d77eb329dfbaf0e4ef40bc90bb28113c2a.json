For now we can call it the Airblaster Movie. This season Airblaster will be expanding their normal feature film style and extend the time frame for production. In the past each project was focused on a month long time frame. This allowed Airblaster to focus on one trip during what is normally a busy year. Airblaster is a busy company with too many things to do for too little people. Each year they give it their all to show you how they view snowboarding. They squeeze in a video project that is one that makes them and hopefully everyone else want to shred. This season Airblaster is branching out and doing a project that will span the course of a few months and a few different adventures. The first trip of the season was to a little known state called North Carolina. What you see here is a short teaser for the Airblaster Movie coming out this fall.\n\nAirblaster would like to thank Capita, High Cascade Snowboard Camp, Method Magazine, Ben Lynch, Eric Messier, Jed Anderson, Nick Dirks, TJ Schneider, Jacob Sutton, Joel Fraser and everyone else helping with this great project. Keep an eye out for teaser #2 soon.\n\n\nXVID 720x480\n128kbps MP3\nDuration: 38:22 minutes\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Almost Dead - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Black Winter - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Elektro - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Forever - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Neverland - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Stance - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Steal This Movie - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Stick Em Up - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - The B - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - This Video Sucks - All Songs]\n[[Snowboard SoundTrack 2009-2010] - Videograss - All Songs]\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.snowboard-zamora.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.snowboard-zamora.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ea291d77eb329dfbaf0e4ef40bc90bb28113c2a","amp;dn":"%5BSnowboard+2010%5D+-+The+Airblaster+Movie+%5BXVid%2BMp3%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ea291d77eb329dfbaf0e4ef40bc90bb28113c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,162,145,215,126,179,41,223,186,240,228,239,64,188,144,187,40,17,60,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
