For those who prefer flac files, converting from ape is no problem: lossless to lossless = lossless. Most media players will do this, I use MediaMonkey. Standalone converters exist, also.I use xrecode. Any computer from the last 5 years can convert to the format of your choice in a matter of minutes (or less) for each CD.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a73f4d34a0484530a8e6de1cfc1996abeb4a7b85","amp;dn":"Mercury+Living+Presence+Collection+%2831-40%29+%5Bape%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a73f4d34a0484530a8e6de1cfc1996abeb4a7b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,63,77,52,160,72,69,48,168,230,222,28,252,25,150,171,235,74,123,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
