Though lonely, she makes the best of her situation and fills her nights seeking love at social dance clubs for single adults. Her fragile happiness changes the day she meets Rodolfo. Their intense passion, to which Gloria gives her all, leaves her vacillating between hope and despair -- until she uncovers a new strength and realizes that, in her golden years, she can shine brighter than ever. GLORIA is Chile's official entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards (R), and stars Paulina GarcÃƒÂ­a in a tour de force performance that captured the Silver Bear Best Actress Award at this year's Berlin Film Festival.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9763f19ae12e83ec25065cbc54a44e5ea8af92","amp;dn":"Gloria+2013+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9763f19ae12e83ec25065cbc54a44e5ea8af92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,151,99,241,154,225,46,131,236,37,6,92,188,84,164,78,94,168,175,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
