Them he met Twoflower, the Discworld&amp;#039;s first tourist, was employed at an outrageous salary as his guide, and has since spent most of his time being shot at, terrorized, chased and hanging from high places with no hope of salvation or, as is now the case, plunging from high places. \n\nA lot more could be said about why these two are dropping out of the world, and why Twoflower&amp;#039;s Luggage, last seen desperately trying to follow him on hundreds of little legs, is no ordinary suitcase, but such questions take time and could be more trouble than they&amp;#039;re worth. For example, it is said that someone once asked the famous philosopher Ly Tin Weedle &quot;Why are you here?&quot; and the reply took three years. \n\nWhat is far more important is an event happening way overhead, far above A&amp;#039;Tuin, the elephants and the rapidly-expiring wizard. The very fabric of time and space is about to be put through the wringer.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nwk72","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61414bf856b62d1bdbe3da857cc5becbc411c000","amp;dn":"02+-+The+Light+Fantastic+-+Terry+Pratchett","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61414bf856b62d1bdbe3da857cc5becbc411c000","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,65,75,248,86,182,45,27,219,227,218,133,124,197,190,203,196,17,192,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
