Was the bomb really an act of \n                extremists, as the media suggest, or a sophisticated \n                killing by a career criminal? Malik doggedly pursues the \n                truth until he, too, becomes a target.\n\n                Inspector Patricia Wright questions his motives but her \n                vision is clouded by personal issues she wants to remain \n                hidden from the squad. Crime has touched her own family.\n\n\nIMDB Rating...: 7.9/10 from 133 users  \n\nLink..........: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0907831/\n\n\nRELEASE NAME..: East.West.101.S02.DVDRip.x264-AUS\nRELEASE DATE..: 02.02.2012\nRUNTiME.......: 354mins\nSiZE..........: 2.94 GB\nViDEO CODEC...: x264, 2-pass, L3.1\nFRAMERATE.....: 25 fps\nBiTRATE.......: 1024 Kbps\nRESOLUTiON....: 720x400 (AR: 16.9)\nAUDiO.........: English, AAC LC 128Kbps Dolby Pro II\nSUBTiTLES.....: None\nSOURCE........: DVD9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:636364da2ce2203b01e5e88c885e3561ea817bbf","amp;dn":"East.West.101.S02.DVDRip.x264-AUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"636364da2ce2203b01e5e88c885e3561ea817bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,99,100,218,44,226,32,59,1,229,232,140,136,94,53,97,234,129,123,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
