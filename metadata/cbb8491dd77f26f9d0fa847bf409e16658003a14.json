A wonderfully tender, horrid, thrilling, bloody and romantic story which feels so real you could easily mistake fiction from fact. \n\nA great number of characters are described, many the author makes you hate, and others love, and makes the story so much more addictive.\n\nFrom the moment I got the book(Brethren) and got into it, I knew I had to get the rest of them. I hope you will enjoy them as much as I did, either in audio-book form, or as I recommend more fiercely; reading the book itself.\n\nI noticed that only Swedish audio-books of Robyn Young's books had been uploaded on TBP, so I thought I might as well put on the mantle, so to speak(might as well while talking about a book about the Temple;), and upload it myself. I am Swedish, but I much prefer the English version, as many others of my origin do as well, I have noticed. \n\nIf enough of you are interested in it, and if enough people are seeding, I will upload the sequel(Crusade) to you. And in time the third and last book(Requiem). \n\nLeave a comment below if you wish to have the sequels, so that I may see the demand for them :)  \n\nEnjoy!\n/MrA\n\nBrethren, written by Robyn Young, read by Christopher Scott.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbb8491dd77f26f9d0fa847bf409e16658003a14","amp;dn":"Brethren+-+Robyn+Young","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbb8491dd77f26f9d0fa847bf409e16658003a14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,184,73,29,215,127,38,249,208,250,132,123,244,9,225,102,88,0,58,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
