The group, which was established in 1995, is building on the musical tradition inspired by other outfits that hail from the same region, including the Descendants, Pennywise, the Circle Jerks, and Black Flag. Bandmembers at first feared that their youth would work against them, since many nightspots in their locale were for ages 21 and older. Despite this worry, the band persevered, drawing inspiration and encouragement from the success of another local young group, the Deviates. 1208 triumphed with their own opportunity to record, and the result was Feedback Is Playback. The albums&amp;#039; producers were Pennywise&amp;#039;s Fletcher Dragge and Darian Rundall. An interesting aside: lead vocalist Alex&amp;#039;s uncle is Greg Ginn, guitarist for punk rockers Black Flag. Raymond Pettibon, another uncle, provided the album&amp;#039;s artwork, evidence of an artistic career that spans several decades.\n\n[b]Review:[/b]\n\nSpecializing in the kind of clear-voiced punk rock brought to the mainstream by the Offspring, 1208 creates memorable punk rock anthems. Their obvious enthusiasm and talent make this album stand above many of the other punk rock offerings that have come out around the same time. Songs like &quot;Jimmy&quot; and &quot;Pick Your Poison&quot; are simple pop-punk songs that lean toward emo and hardcore at times. But their delivery really makes it all, as they realize that it takes a certain amount of seriousness to really put across these songs. Their singer, Alex, really puts his all into his vocals, ending up somewhere between Dexter Holland (of the Offspring) and On&amp;#039;s Ken Andrews. And the guitar/bass interplay tries to add the little Bob Mould touches that give this music the depth it needs, ÃƒÂ  la At the Drive In. With all the comparisons, it may seem as though the band is quite unoriginal. Luckily, the genre lends itself to bands such as this, and they do manage to throw enough of their own personality into the music to give it their own personal stamp. Overall, this is a great debut for a band that has boatloads of potential but has not had the chance to prove itself to the punk rock community.\n\n[b]Tracks:[/b]\n\n   1. 1988\n   2.
