The story was created by Robert L. May in 1939 as part of his employment with Montgomery Ward.\n\nThe story is owned by The Rudolph Company, L.P. and has been sold in numerous forms including a popular song, a television special (done in stop motion animation), and a feature film. Character Arts, LLC manages the licensing for the Rudolph Company, L.P. Although the story and song are not public domain, Rudolph has become a figure of Christmas folklore.\n\nThe song tells the tale of Santa Claus' ninth and lead reindeer who possesses an unusually red-colored nose that gives off its own light, powerful enough to illuminate the team's path through inclement weather.\n\n8 Days of Christmas is a Christmas album by R&amp;B girl group Destiny's Child, released by Columbia Records in October 2001 in the United States. It debuted at number seventy-five on the U.S. Billboard 200 selling over 23,000 copies during its first week of release, and it eventually peaked at number thirty-four a few weeks later. It was certified gold by the RIAA in December 2001 for over 500,000 copies shipped in the United States.\n\nIn 2004, a re-issued version of the album was released, containing previously unreleased records.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77bc551e91601cc0688ea95f9835802ffbdda559","amp;dn":"Destiny%5C%27s+Child+-+Rudolph+The+Red-Nosed+Reindeer++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77bc551e91601cc0688ea95f9835802ffbdda559","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,188,85,30,145,96,28,192,104,142,169,95,152,53,128,47,251,221,165,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
