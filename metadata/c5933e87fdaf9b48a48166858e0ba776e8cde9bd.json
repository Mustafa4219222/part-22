Despite the increase in sales for his previous two albums, Mirror Blue was held back. The delay was partly due to changes at the top at Capitol Records which saw long time Thompson fan and supporter Hale Milgrim being replaced by Gary Gersh.\n\nWhen the album was eventually released it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t enjoy the record company support given to ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous releases on Capitol.\n\nUnusually for a new Thompson release, Mirror Blue was not given a warm welcome by the critics. Criticism of the album was centered on the controversial production rather than on ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s songs and playing, both of which are strong on this album.\n\nThompson: &quot;I thought it was a sort of deconstruction of the rock rhythm section... It was a radical record ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and a brave record ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it was off the back of the records Mitchell had done with Suzanne Vega and Los Lobos and the couple of records [engineer] Tchad Blake had done with Tom Waits. All of which I thought were terrific records and they all had a kind of character to them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a sound that was really trying to strip away some clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s, like why have a snare drum, why the backbeat? And just looking at the song and seeing what does the song need, whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to work?&quot;\n\nThe critics did not agree and the album was slammed for its unusual percussion and its lack of reverb. The charge was that the heavy-handed production drowned the songs. Mitchell Froom was cast as the villain of the piece, but Thompson seems to have been at least in favour of the production and quite probably a willing participant.\n\nDespite the critical backlash and the poor sales, some of the songs on the album have become concert staples and favourites of ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fans. In particular &quot;Beeswing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a tale about a travelling girl and the prices that she and the young man who falls in love with her pay for the choices they make ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ has come to be regarded as one of ThompsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very best compositions. Songs such as &quot;Mingus Eyes&quot;, &quot;Easy There, Steady Now&quot; and &quot;I Ride In Your Slipstream&quot; have a jazzy feel and impressionistic lyrics, showing that whatever else he was doing Thompson was continuing to extend his artistic range.\n\nOn March 10, 2009, &quot;The Way That It Shows&quot; was released as a downloadable song for the video game Rock Band 2\n\n[edit] Track listing\nAll songs written by Richard Thompson.\n\n&quot;For The Sake Of Mary&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19 \n&quot;I CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Wake Up To Save My Life&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11 \n&quot;MGB-GT&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35 \n&quot;The Way That It Shows&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:08 \n&quot;Easy There, Steady Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43 \n&quot;King Of Bohemia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42 \n&quot;Shane And Dixie&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05 \n&quot;Mingus Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47 \n&quot;I Ride In Your Slipstream&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06 \n&quot;Beeswing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30 \n&quot;Fast Food&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:44 \n&quot;Mascara Tears&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36 \n&quot;Taking My Business Elsewhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28 \n[edit] Personnel\nRichard Thompson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals, mandolin \nMitchell Froom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ keyboards \nJerry Scheff ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar, double bass \nPete Thomas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion \nChristine Collister ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals \nMichael Parker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals \nJohn Kirkpatrick - accordion, concertinas \nDanny Thompson - double bass on &quot;Easy There, Steady Now&quot; \nAlistair Anderson - concertina, Northumbrian pipes \nTom McConville - fiddle \nMartin Dunn - flute \nPhilip Pickett - shawms \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5933e87fdaf9b48a48166858e0ba776e8cde9bd","amp;dn":"Richard+Thompson...Mirror+Blue%281994%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5933e87fdaf9b48a48166858e0ba776e8cde9bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,147,62,135,253,175,155,72,164,129,102,133,142,11,167,118,232,205,233,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
