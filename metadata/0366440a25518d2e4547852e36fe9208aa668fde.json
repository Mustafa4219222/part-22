I suggest looking for that item if you were avoiding this because it was on vinyl only.\n***END***\n\nThis Toronto post-punk outfit's 2007 vinyl-only release, Year Of The Pig, is the second in a series of 12&quot; vinyls related to the signs of the Chinese zodiac system.\n\nSide A is a 19-minute epic track, pushing the limits of post-punk into near prog territories, while Side B brings back the familiar post-punk riffage of old.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best thing these Canadian musicians have released to date.\n\nRipped directly from the vinyl (right after purchasing) using a Technics turntable connected to an XPSound XP-202 USB stereo preamp, recorded and boosted to 0.3dB below peaking using Sony Soundforge 8.0, and then converted from the .wav file directly to .flac lossless audio. \n\nShare and enjoy! This was next to impossible to find online, until now!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0366440a25518d2e4547852e36fe9208aa668fde","amp;dn":"Fucked+Up+-+Year+Of+The+Pig+%282007%29+punk%2Fhardcore+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0366440a25518d2e4547852e36fe9208aa668fde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,102,68,10,37,81,141,46,69,71,133,46,54,254,146,8,170,102,143,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
