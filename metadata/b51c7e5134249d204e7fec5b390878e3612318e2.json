Educational : Other quality : English\n\n\nTo understand the Vikings is to conquer a paradox. From 790-1066, virtually invincible Viking fleets fanned out across Europe, raiding, plundering, and overwhelming every army that opposed them. \n\nAs explorers and traders, the Vikings sailed from Newfoundland to Baghdad, across raging seas and swift rivers, extending trade and prosperity in voyages of creative destruction. They played a decisive role in the formation of Latin Christendom and particularly of Western Europe, which was forged in the crucible of Viking fire. \n\nBy 1100, however, the Vikings had disappeared, having willingly shed their identity and dissolved into the mists of myth and legend, their ancient gods unheralded, their distinctive culture gone. How did this happen, and how should we remember this formidable civilization that, for being so formative, proved so transient?\n\nWho were the Vikings? Many more things, perhaps, than you may have thought: raiders, seafarers, kings, and writers, a people who truly defined the history of Europe, and whose brave, adventurous, and creative spirit still survives today.\n\nIn 36 fascinating, fact-packed lectures, Dr. Kenneth W. Harl rediscovers these warriors, artists, merchants, poets, and kings, explaining their role on the world stage.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles\n\n1. The Vikings in Medieval History\n2.
