Consigned to rounding up two giant man-chickens, copious quantities of caffeine provide Mattie with the unexpected burst of energy needed to tackle the mystery of the cream cake and save the egg threatened minister.\n\nProgramme Two\n\nA courtroom showdown sees Mattie out-wit his ex-girlfriend's solicitor only to draw the ire of the Super who begins to plot against him.\n\nMattie gets a new flat-mate and befriends a petty thief before stepping over the line while trying to sort out a dodgy mechanic.\n\nIs this the Super's chance to send our hapless detective packing or will his partner Sharon save the day?\n\nProgramme Three\n\nMattie and Sharon are dispatched to deal with a particularly persistent shoplifter. Meanwhile, Mattie's interfering mother sets him up with a blind date, while Tom and Felix interview a man with a penchant for insulting the police. Mattie goes undercover with disastrous consequences for his fledgling love-life.\n\nProgramme Four\n\nThe death of an elderly business man looks like an open and shut case but Mattie has his doubts. To Mattie's (and especially his detective partner Sharon's) embarrassment, new flat-mate Ross proves to be quite the ladies man about town.\n\nAn exhibition of arty photos by two forensic snappers takes his mind off domestic life. Finally, a snoop around the dead man's furniture proves instrumental in proving Mattie's suspicions of foul play to be right on the money.\n\netc\n\n\nFile Info:\nComplete name                            : Mattie.S01E01.The.Pilot.RTE.DVDrip.DeViL303.avi\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 377 MiB\nDuration                                 : 23mn 57s\nOverall bit rate                         : 2 198 Kbps\nMovie name                               : MATTIE_SCN.Title2.DVDRip\nWriting application                      : Lavf53.21.0\nOriginal source form/Name                : MATTIE_SCN\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                              : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 23mn 57s\nBit rate                                 : 1 994 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 404 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.229\nStream size                              : 342 MiB (91%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 23mn 57s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 32.9 MiB (9%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 32 ms (0.96 video frame)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e78faba06ccfdb974b286a3ba548421d65c5cb7","amp;dn":"Mattie+Series+1+Complete+%5BRTE+Ireland%5D+DVDrip+Xvid+DeViL303","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e78faba06ccfdb974b286a3ba548421d65c5cb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,120,250,186,6,204,253,185,116,178,134,163,186,84,132,33,214,92,92,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
