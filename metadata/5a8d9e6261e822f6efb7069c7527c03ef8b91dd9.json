Effortlessly, the assassin slips through the police's fingers, and his absence sparks a blaze of accusations about who ordered the hit. \n\nSeated at a nearby table, reporter Nick Daniels is conducting a once-in-a-lifetime interview with a legendary baseball bad-boy. In the chaos, he accidentally captures a key piece of evidence that lands him in the middle of an all-out war between Italian and Russian mafia forces. NYPD captains, district attorneys, mayoral candidates, media kingpins, and one shockingly beautiful magazine editor are all pushing their own agendas--on both sides of the law.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a8d9e6261e822f6efb7069c7527c03ef8b91dd9","amp;dn":"Don%27t+Blink+by+James+Patterson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a8d9e6261e822f6efb7069c7527c03ef8b91dd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,141,158,98,97,232,34,246,239,183,6,156,117,39,192,62,248,185,29,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
