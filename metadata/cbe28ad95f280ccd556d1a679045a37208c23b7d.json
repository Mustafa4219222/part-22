Spliced Networks LLC began publication in November of 2005. The publication ceased production from October 2006 until July 2007 as the format, content and direction of the magazine were redesigned. The magazine relaunched on July 14, 2007.\n\nEach month O3 looked at all aspects of enterprise data networking from network level solutions such as firewalls, routers, switching to server side applications such as FreeRadius, OpenLDAP and Apache.\n\nThe goal of O3 was to introduce Enterprise Data Networking technologies to small and medium sized businesses, discuss open source solutions for providing those technologies and to provide the technical information on how to deploy and maintain those solutions.\n\nHowever O3 was not just targeted at small and medium sized business, as the solutions discussed were already deployed at the time in most large businesses, government agencies and educational institutions... just not necessarily OPEN SOURCE solutions. It was seen that even CIOs, CTOs, IT management and staff at larger entities could benefit from exposure to lower cost open source alternatives.\n\nO3 itself was designed, developed and published using open source technology exclusively. Every article in O3 was written in Open Office under Linux, those articles were then imported into Scribus, while graphics artwork was created with the Gimp. Scribus was used to export the completed publication in PDF.\n\nEach month an issue was in production O3 provided a roundup of open source events, as well as upcoming event calendars. O3 also provided an Ã¢â‚¬Å“Open Source ReportÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which was a short roundup of interesting open source software that had been released over the preceding month.\n\nEach issue of O3 would normally feature Security, Internet, Web Tech, Business, Networking, VoIP, Network Applications and Network Security columns... all from the open source perspective.\n________________________\n\nAbbreviated overview of contents:\n\nLightTPD web server reviewed\nLISA...
