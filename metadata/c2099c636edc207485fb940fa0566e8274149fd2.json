This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nJohn Lennon debuts his song &quot;Imagine&quot; on the hot 100 all the way up at number 20, and Isaac Hayes moves his song &quot;Theme From Shaft&quot; from number 50 to number 9!\n\nThere is a spoken-word record in the countdown of a poem from a popular poster that appears to be a reproduction of a manuscript dated 1692, which would make it three centuries old, but it isn't. Casey gives the details.\n\nAt number 29 is Freddy Hart with his hit &quot;Easy Loving&quot; voted Song-of-the-Year by the Country Music Association.\n\nThere is a hit by an artist who once scored points with his girlfriend by making a recording artist out of her little brother.\n\n40: I'm Coming Home - Tommy James\n39: The Love We Had Stays On My Mind - The Dells\n38: A Natural Man - Low Rawls\n37: Woman's Love Rights - Laura Lee\n36: Long Ago And Far Away - James Taylor\n35: Desiderata - Les Crane\n34: You've Got To Crawl (Before You) - The 8th Day\n33.
