It's an effect that combines panning, delay and doppler effects to create virtual surround sound with 2 channels. The result is a listening experience that transcends normally recorded stereo. It mimics the natural hearing cues created by our head and ears to create the impression of 3D sound when listening through headphones.\r\n\r\nI'm a big surround music fan and made this album so I can listen it through headphones on a portable player. The sources are all surround versions of the tracks ripped from SACD's, DVDA's and DTS DVD's. It was a lot of work, and while a binaural track will never be as good as the original surround mix or recording, I'm quite pleased with the result.\r\n\r\nCodec: FLAC\r\nSample rate: 44100 Hz\r\nBits per sample: 16\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
