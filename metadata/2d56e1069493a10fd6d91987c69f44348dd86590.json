PARKER\nSea Change\n\nOver a career spanning more than three decades, Robert B. Parker has moved effortlessly among genres and from one bestselling series to the next. While each new literary creation has garnered him praise, it is the compassionate, heroic, and troubled police chief Jesse Stone who has achieved unparalleled acclaim: &quot;Jesse Stone comes into his own big-time .... A star is born&quot; said &quot;Kirkus&quot; in its starred review of Stone Cold. &quot;Parker's most rewardingly complicated shamus.&quot; wrote &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.\n \nWhen a woman's partially decomposed body washes ashore in Paradise, Stone is forced into a case far more difficult than it initially appears. Identifying the woman is just the first step in what proves to be a treacherous and emotionally charged investigation. Florence Horvath was an attractive, recently divorced heiress from Florida; she also had a penchant for steamy sex and was an enthusiastic participant in a video depicting the same. Somehow the combination of her past and her present got her killed, but no one is talkimg--not the crew of the &quot;Ladv Jane&quot;, the Fort Lauderdale yacht moored in Paradise Harbor; not Florence's very blonde, very tan twin sisters. Corliss and Claudia; and not her curiouslv affectless parents, livine: out a sterile retirement in a Miami hieh-rise. But someone--Jesse--has to sneak for the dead, even if it puts him in harm's way.\n \nRobert B. Parker is the author of more than fifty books, including the bestsellers &quot;Appaloosa&quot; and &quot;Cold Service&quot;. He lives in Boston.\n\nRead by: Scott Sowers\n\nFrom 5 Audio CDs at 160 kbps in MP3 Format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d56e1069493a10fd6d91987c69f44348dd86590","amp;dn":"Robert+B.+Parker+-+Sea+Change","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d56e1069493a10fd6d91987c69f44348dd86590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,86,225,6,148,147,161,15,214,217,25,135,198,159,68,52,141,216,101,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
