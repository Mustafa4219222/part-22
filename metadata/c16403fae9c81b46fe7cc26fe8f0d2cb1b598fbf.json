In this special programme, friends and Corrie colleagues applaud the work of Beverley Callard, who plays Liz. The show reveals how Beverley made the character of Liz her own after arriving on the soap in 1989 and established Liz as the leader of the McDonald clan. It explains how the family was created and how Beverley had a part to play in casting her two onscreen sons. Plus there is a look at how Liz worked her way through a string of unsuitable men - and a wardrobe of unsuitable clothes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16403fae9c81b46fe7cc26fe8f0d2cb1b598fbf","amp;dn":"Coronation+Street+-+Farewell+Liz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16403fae9c81b46fe7cc26fe8f0d2cb1b598fbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,100,3,250,233,200,27,70,254,124,194,111,232,240,210,203,27,89,143,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
