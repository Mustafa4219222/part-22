A number of songs from the album gained significant radio and TV exposure, notably &quot;You Might Think&quot;, which had a memorable music video in heavy rotation on MTV in 1984 and 1985. Another hit single frequently seen on MTV was &quot;Magic&quot;, in which singer/songwriter Ric Ocasek walked on waterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that is, the water in a swimming pool at a backyard barbecue party. This song reached #12 in the U.S. The &quot;Drive&quot; video (directed by actor Timothy Hutton) showed Ocasek, who did not sing the song, arguing with a troubled young woman played by model Paulina Porizkova, whom Ocasek would soon marry. &quot;Hello Again&quot; had a video directed by the legendary Andy Warhol -- who also appeared onscreen, further raising the video's curiosity factor. The song &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot; was used in the theatrical trailer of the 1986 film Top Gun, but it never made it into the soundtrack.\n\n   1. &quot;Hello Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n   2. &quot;Looking for Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n   3. &quot;Magic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n   4. &quot;Drive&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n   5. &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n   6. &quot;You Might Think&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n   7. &quot;It's Not the Night&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n   8. &quot;Why Can't I Have You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n   9. &quot;I Refuse&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n  10. &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587dd0a4d2e0bafe1309ec8f8957d3f5dc740f3f","amp;dn":"The+Cars+-+Heartbeat+City+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587dd0a4d2e0bafe1309ec8f8957d3f5dc740f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,125,208,164,210,224,186,254,19,9,236,143,137,87,211,245,220,116,15,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
