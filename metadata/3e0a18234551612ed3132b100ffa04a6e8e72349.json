Two songs were also not included in the original vinyl release for space reasons (tracks 1 and 7 here).  This bowdlerised version was how the album was released, and known for years.\n\nThe original acetates were mastered in July 2005, and were released later that year as a disc entitled &quot;Originals&quot;.  This disc comprises the original 1969 album recordings - including the two tracks which didn't fit on the original LP - with the original mixes unaltered, as the band had originally intended them.  (NB, the tracks on this CD issue are presented in a different order to that on the original 1969 LP release; but all filenames here are marked to show the original track order too.)\n\nThis upload also contains the band's only 7&quot; single ('Go Your Way' / 'Keep Out Cos I'm Dying') released in 1969, the same year as the album.  Neither of these tracks was on the original LP, and they are not otherwise available on this site.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e0a18234551612ed3132b100ffa04a6e8e72349","amp;dn":"Andromeda+-+Originals%28original+mix+of+1969+LP%29+%2B7in+single+%28mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e0a18234551612ed3132b100ffa04a6e8e72349","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,10,24,35,69,81,97,46,211,19,43,16,15,250,4,166,232,231,35,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
