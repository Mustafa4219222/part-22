(Springer, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book provides an overview of the fundamentals and reference values for Ca stable isotope research, as well as current analytical methodologies including detailed instructions for sample preparation and isotope analysis. As such, it introduces readers to the different fields of application, including low-temperature mineral precipitation and biomineralisation, Earth surface processes and global cycling, high-temperature processes and cosmochemistry, and lastly human studies and biomedical applications. The current state of the art in these major areas is discussed, and open questions and possible future directions are identified. In terms of its depth and coverage, the current work extends and complements the previous reviews of Ca stable isotope geochemistry, addressing the needs of graduate students and advanced researchers who want to familiarize themselves with Ca stable isotope research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2498ae6a7850fb1e10b7d41e8758d29011279059","amp;dn":"Calcium+Stable+Isotope+Geochemistry+-+Nikolaus+Gussone+et+al.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2498ae6a7850fb1e10b7d41e8758d29011279059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,152,174,106,120,80,251,30,16,183,212,30,135,88,210,144,17,39,144,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
