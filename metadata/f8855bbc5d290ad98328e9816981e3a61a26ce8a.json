It's also the version currently available in stores, on HDCD.  This is a rip of that HDCD.\n\nThe Aoxomoxoa original mix has not been available since at the latest 1971, when it was replaced by a Garcia/Lesh remix that made the album a bit less trippy and weird.  The great original mix is &quot;great&quot; for being so very strange and at times inscrutable.  The version included here is a vinyl rip ALLEGEDLY from a reissued vinyl version of the original mix.  Frankly I can't say for sure that it's not from an old LP, but there is a minimum of surface noise which suggests that it may be a recent vinyl issue.  It sure sounds better than most of my LPs and they're not nearly as old as the collectible original vinyl Aoxomoxoa.\n\nSo anyhow here's the track list:\n\n01 That's It for the Other One\n02 New Potato Caboose\n03 Born Cross-Eyed\n04 St. Stephen\n05 Dupree's Diamond Blues\n06 Rosemary\n07 Doin' That Rag\n08 Mountains of the Moon\n09 China Cat Sunflower\n10 What's Become of the Baby\n11 Cosmic Charlie\n12 Alligator\n13 Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks)\n\nTracks 1-3, 12 and 13 are the Anthem of the Sun LP.\nTracks 4-11 are the vinyl rip of Aoxomoxoa.\n\nVolume levels were adjusted with replay gain (applying album gain for each album) to make the two albums sit better together on one CD.  Burn the CD or play the FLAC files with NO GAPS between the tracks please.  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8855bbc5d290ad98328e9816981e3a61a26ce8a","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+Anthem+%2B+Aoxomoxoa+Original+Mixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8855bbc5d290ad98328e9816981e3a61a26ce8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,133,91,188,93,41,10,217,131,40,233,129,105,129,227,166,26,38,206,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
