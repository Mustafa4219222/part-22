Through a survey of the patterns of sexual expression found among animals and among societies around the world, and an examination of the functional role homosexual behavior has played among animal species and human societies alike, the author arrives at some provocative conclusions: that a homosexual or bisexual phase is a normal part of sexual development, that same-sex relations play an important balancing role in regulating human reproduction, that many societies have institutionalized homosexual traditions in the past, and that the harsh condemnation of homosexuality in Western society is a relatively recent phenomenon, unique among world societies throughout history. This well researched and meticulously documented book is the first that integrates into a coherent picture the startling revelations about human sexuality coming from the recent work of sexual researchers, psychologists, anthropologists and historians. The view that emerges, of an ambisexual human species whose complex sexual harmony is being thwarted by the imposition of an artificial understanding of nature, represents a new way of thinking about sex.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d073dd3bad8427d5a97e0465c6a8226cf9ecd8d","amp;dn":"The+Origins+and+Role+of+Same-Sex+Relations+in+Human+Societies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d073dd3bad8427d5a97e0465c6a8226cf9ecd8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,7,61,211,186,216,66,125,90,151,224,70,92,106,130,38,207,158,205,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
