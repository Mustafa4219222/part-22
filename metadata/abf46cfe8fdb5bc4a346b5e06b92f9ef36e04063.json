It is nearly impossible to find torrent files that include all the extras or even important commentaries. These files are from my collection of DVDs that I have made from rented movies over the last seven years or so. Nearly all of them have been put onto a DVD5, so unfortunately I do not have an uncompressed source handy.  That said I can assure you that these look GREAT on larger screens. I chose to make them this size for economy as DVD9s were $3 each when I started this and DVD5s were .25 cents each. Now I am working on putting some of the best ones on a hard drive to be played with my HD TV Media Player and am still thinking economy is the best rule as these are half the size of ripping a DVD9. This is the best quality for the value.\n\nI would love some productive feedback  . . .   :)\n\nThis is a DVD rip to an ISO so you can watch it on your media player, mount it to a virtual drive or burn it to a DVD.\n\nThis file includes EVERYTHING the original DVD has:\n\n1952\n91 minutes\nBlack and White\n1.33:1\nSpoken Language: English, French\nSubtitles: English\n\nAudio commentary by author Eddie Muller\nEddie Muller is a writer based in San Francisco.
