The life of Cuba s last great rumbero is detailed in THE LAST RUMBA OF PAPA MONTERO, a bold story that captures Cuban traditions and culture through beautiful imagery, sensual music, and the most scorching Latin dance ever invented. Afro-Cuban mythology serves as the force behind the narrative as mythic figures guide the characters through the events of the story.\n\n\nSARA GOMEZ: AN AFRO-CUBAN FILMMAKER\n\nAcclaimed filmmaker Sara Gomez comes to life in the rich, multilayer-ed documentary SARA GOMEZ: AN AFRO-CUBAN FILMMAKER. Though trained in ethnography, Gomez became the first female Cuban filmmaker. Her background shaped her films, which reflect her interests in Afro-Cuban cultural traditions and women's issues. Friends and family members recall her talent, intelligence, and generosity. Ultimately SARA GOMEZ is a love story between Sara and her husband (filmmaker Germinal Hernandez), Sara and her family, and Sara and her culture.\n\n\n\nMore of my music &amp; movie downloads that you may find of interest are located here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/rubusdemonoid/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5b221c467a449ecb37d15de03d15a7010c8f66","amp;dn":"Afro-Cuba+-+Yesterday+%26+Today","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5b221c467a449ecb37d15de03d15a7010c8f66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,91,34,28,70,122,68,158,203,55,209,93,224,61,21,167,1,12,143,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
