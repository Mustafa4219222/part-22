It shows. If Springsteen held himself to his usual high standards, only half of these songs would've been released. Also, many of the songs sound overproduced - too many bells and whistles thrown in and not enough focus on the vocals and guitars.\nThat being said, lyrically, &quot;Real World&quot; is one of Springsteen's best songs. &quot;I Wish I Were Blind,&quot; &quot;Man's Job,&quot; &quot;Human Touch,&quot; and &quot;With Every Wish&quot; are also excellent songs. &quot;Roll of the Dice&quot; is one of those songs that doesn't work too well on the album, but is great live.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 84\nArtist: Bruce Springsteen\nAlbum: Human Touch\nYear: 1992\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6a45d969881f0969db58c09e574243f7d04254d","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+Human+Touch+%5BFLAC-1992%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6a45d969881f0969db58c09e574243f7d04254d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,164,93,150,152,129,240,150,157,181,140,9,229,116,36,63,125,4,37,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
