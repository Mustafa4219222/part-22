Several songs are performed in duet by Clapton on acoustic guitar and Doyle Bramhall II on steel string acoustic and dobro guitars. Between sessions, Clapton discusses Johnson's profound influence on him and other musicians. One notable segment features Clapton performing in the 508 Park Avenue building (http://508park.org) in Dallas, Texas, that served as a makeshift studio in 1937 for Johnson to cut his legendary recordings.\n\nSee also:-\n\nRelated album - Me and Mr Johnson - http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9368820\n\nMe and Mr. Johnson is the 16th studio album by Eric Clapton released in 2004. The album is a tribute to legendary bluesman Robert Johnson. According to Clapton's autobiography, the recordings weren't intended to become an album. The band had rented the studio, but Clapton didn't have any songs written, so he suggested they record Robert Johnson songs. They recorded enough songs for an album and it was decided to release them as such.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:350871897b0e2265cef4ffe5f718f92c35307693","amp;dn":"Sessions+For+Robert+J.+-+Eric+Clapton+-+Delta+Blues+-+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"350871897b0e2265cef4ffe5f718f92c35307693","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,8,113,137,123,14,34,101,206,244,255,229,247,24,249,44,53,48,118,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
