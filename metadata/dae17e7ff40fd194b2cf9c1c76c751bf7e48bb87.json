There's also Syed Shah, who took his chances by transforming a modest Bedfordshire bungalow into a seven-bedroom mansion, as well as Norfolk couple Rodney and Pam, who are approaching the end of an eight-year battle with their local council over their modified property.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThe series following eccentric individuals who have fallen foul of planning laws continues as landlord Andy Fannon finds that his pub's grade II-listed status threatens the large extension he added to accommodate extra rugby fans, while Dr Mohammed Sidda of Bolton's dream home building grows beyond the plans and sparks ire from neighbours. In rural Wales, eco-idealist Eddie McIntosh has spent nine years building and operating an off-grid retreat, which is popular with the surrounding community but displeases the powers that be at Powys county council. The stress of conducting his own defence has devastating consequences for Eddie and his family.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nIn the Hertfordshire green belt, David Lloyd battles to save the luxury log cabin he's lived in since 2003 after importing it from Canada. With time running out, he takes drastic steps to delay its destruction. Meanwhile, Jon Martin faces a dilemma over whether he should honour a demolition order or save a group of endangered bats nesting in the straw house he built near Bristol. Eastender Brian Gage admits he likes a battle, but as his more recent dispute draws to a conclusion, events take a bizarre and life-threatening turn.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;aae2c3cdc2eae69e849b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3197 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 192kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 1.05 GB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dae17e7ff40fd194b2cf9c1c76c751bf7e48bb87","amp;dn":"Damned.Designs.Dont.Demolish.My.Home.3of3.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dae17e7ff40fd194b2cf9c1c76c751bf7e48bb87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,225,126,127,244,15,209,148,178,207,156,28,118,199,81,191,126,72,187,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
