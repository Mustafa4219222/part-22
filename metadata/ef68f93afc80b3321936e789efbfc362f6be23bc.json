These should allow assessment of the state-of-the-art in a particular domain and to develop a feeling of its further evolution without claiming to be exhaustive. The subjects covered are not limited to the classical chemical engineering disciplines. Contributions connecting chemical engineering to related scientific fields, either providing a fundamental basis or introducing new concepts and tools, are encouraged. Of course applications of chemical engineering receive special attention. A balance between well developed areas such as process industry, transformation of materials, energy and environmental issues and areas where applications of chemical engineering are more recent or emerging is aimed at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef68f93afc80b3321936e789efbfc362f6be23bc","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Chemical+Engineering+%5BUpdated+at+2016.02.04%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef68f93afc80b3321936e789efbfc362f6be23bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,104,249,58,252,128,179,50,25,54,231,137,239,191,195,98,246,190,35,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
