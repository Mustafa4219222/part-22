As colonial forces moved in , their ruthless punitive raids became an open war of extermination. Thousands of the indigenous people were killed or driven out into the desert to die. By 1905, the survivors were interned in concentration camps, and systematically starved and worked to death.\n\nYears later, the people and ideas that drove the ethnic cleansing of German South West Africa would influence the formation of the Nazi party. The Kaiser's Holocaust uncovers extraordinary links between the two regimes: their ideologies, personnel, even symbols and uniform.\n\nThe Herero and Nama genocide was deliberately concealed for almost a century. Today, as the graves of the victims are uncovered, its re-emergence challenges the belief that Nazism was an aberration in European history. The Kaiser's Holocaust passionately narrates this harrowing story and explores one of the defining episodes of the twentieth century from a new angle. Moving, powerful and unforgettable, it is a story that needs to be told.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7ad1c57654ccbc9df86614c2ebe2497b60eb6e","amp;dn":"The+Kaiser%27s+Holocaust%3A+Germany%27s+Forgotten+Genocide+and+the+Col","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7ad1c57654ccbc9df86614c2ebe2497b60eb6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,122,209,197,118,84,204,188,157,248,102,20,194,235,226,73,123,96,235,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
