It is about a &quot;hacker ethic&quot; that led to major breakthroughs in technology, and forever changed our world. From the first MIT hackers to popular Silicon Valley inventors, this program covers this fascinating cultural phenomenon through interviews with twelve of its early pioneers.\n\nThis half-hour program features conversations with: Steve Wozniak, designer of the Apple II; Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson, designers of the Macintosh; Homebrew Computer Club leader Lee Felsenstein; MIT hackers Richard Stallman and Richard Greenblatt; and many more.\n\nHackers was produced over a decade before the advent of the Internet. All interviews were shot over a long week-end in 1984, at the first Hackers Conference, hosted by Whole Earth Catalog editors Stewart Brand and Kevin Kelley, in Sausalito, California. This event was inspired by Steven LevyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s classic book Hackers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Heroes of the Computer Revolution.\n\nRunning time: 26 minutes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01014a806615fe8f5d7f86868a83500d5f2cad07","amp;dn":"Hackers+-+Wizards+of+the+Electronic+Age+%5BUncle.X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01014a806615fe8f5d7f86868a83500d5f2cad07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,1,74,128,102,21,254,143,93,127,134,134,138,131,80,13,95,44,173,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
