Progress in nanotech is helping the nuclear industry slash the cost of energy production. It also continues to improve application reliability and safety measures, which remain a critical concern, especially since the reactor disasters in Japan.\r\n\r\nExploring the new wide-ranging landscape of nuclear function, Atomic Nanoscale Technology in the Nuclear Industry details the breakthroughs in nanoscale applications and methodologies that are revolutionizing power production, biotechnology, and material science.\r\n\r\nDevelopments in atomic nanoscale technology have given us the ability to:\r\n\r\nUse ion beams to Investigate and optimize radiation energy losses at the nanoscopic level\r\n\r\nAssess nanoscopic safety circumstances involved in a reactor failure\r\n\r\nAnalyze characteristics of nuclear spacecraft operating in the nanogravity of deep space\r\n\r\nEvaluate light collection enhancement for digital X-ray detection\r\n\r\nApply brachytherapy using radioisotopes for cancer therapy\r\n\r\nTreat nuclear waste at the nanoscopic level\r\n\r\nUse systems-thinking decision making to analyze financial progress of nanotech in the energy industry\r\n\r\nAssess safety (and safety management methods) for nuclear nanomaterials used in plant operations\r\n\r\nRepresenting a first step in multi-combinatorial research, this text incorporates advanced studies that use Monte Carlo and solid-state measurement (including radiation detection) methods. Researchers used these to demonstrate the potential to upgrade methods of radiation protection and nuclear reactor operation (safety, waste disposal, etc.). The author also addresses how we can use nanotechnology to address industrial concerns and enhance nuclear medicine techniques. He highlights several nanomaterial systems and devices to illustrate developments in this area.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author:\r\n\r\nTaeho Woo launched the specialized field of atomic multinology (interdisciplinary research of nuclear technology), which combines the application of information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology in the nuclear industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d95229c4b560de692a82a701baf715eca3357c7d","amp;dn":"Atomic+Nanoscalnology+in+the+Nuclear+Industry+-+Taeho+Woo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d95229c4b560de692a82a701baf715eca3357c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,82,41,196,181,96,222,105,42,130,167,1,186,247,21,236,163,53,124,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
