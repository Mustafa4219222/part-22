Told by his superiors that what he has found is nothing more than a downed weather balloon, Marcel maintains his military duty until the weight of the truth, however out of this world it may be, forces him to piece together what really occurred. Adapted from real-life events portrayed in the book _UFO Crash at Roswell_ by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a05caccc296a7c0d17b8de8afa7ea6854bf77ecc","amp;dn":"Roswell+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a05caccc296a7c0d17b8de8afa7ea6854bf77ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,92,172,204,41,106,124,13,23,184,222,138,250,126,166,133,75,247,126,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
