Three came out. None even a shadow of who they once were.\n\nWhen their car breaks down, Dee, her boyfriend Luke, and his brother Mike walk through a winter storm to take refuge in a nearby town called Purity Springs. When they arrive, the emergency sirens are blaring and the small farming town seems abandoned. With no other shelter, they spend the night in an empty house.\n\nBut they soon discover that not everything in Purity Springs is as it seems. When the town's inhabitants suddenly appear the next morning, Dee, Luke, and Mike find themselves at the mercy of the charismatic leader, Elijah Hawkins, who plans to make Dee his new wife. Elijah's son, Joseph, offers to help them escape . . . but the price of his help may be more than Dee and her friends can bear","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df17becbf597ecdceef94a9e7628b801be5d9994","amp;dn":"Creed+by+Trisha+Leaver+%26amp%3B+Lindsay+Currie+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df17becbf597ecdceef94a9e7628b801be5d9994","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,23,190,203,245,151,236,220,238,249,74,158,118,40,184,1,190,93,153,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
