Follow these two lovable losers as they trek across the USA in their battered eighteen-wheeler, doling out misdirected hatred to all they encounter, and eventually succumbing to their long-repressed lust for each other! Trucker Fags in Denial marks writer Jim Goad's first crack at writing a feature-length comic book since his recent 3-year bid in an Oregon prison. Artist Jim Blanchard, perhaps best known in the comic world as the Harvey-nominated inker for the final 15 issues of Peter Bagge's HATE comics, has never been to prison. Don't miss this sleazy, lovingly-crafted underground comic opus!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a52dbfd1d1b2094856c28dc958002282b5447d7","amp;dn":"Jim+Goad%3A+Trucker+Fags+in+Denial+%28Fantagraphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a52dbfd1d1b2094856c28dc958002282b5447d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,82,219,253,29,27,32,148,133,108,40,220,149,128,2,40,43,84,71,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
