We live in a country where one third of the food we produce never gets eaten, and the average family bins Â£700-worth of food a year. Hugh believes something needs to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nFirst he confronts ordinary shoppers in the supermarket, armed with a wheelie bin. He's going to try to take their shopping off them before they have even left the store... after all, they are only going to throw it away later in the week, so why not save them the bother of taking it home? Then he heads to a parsnip farm in Norfolk, where he uncovers the truth about the supermarkets' strict cosmetic standards, which means that any slightly imperfect fruit or veg gets rejected. In a bid to get everyone in the country to think more about how much food we bin and what we throw away, Hugh goes undercover as a bin man. Poking through people's bins, he gets to see first hand just how much stuff gets thrown away which shouldn't be.\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nHugh Fearnley-Whittingstall concludes his mission to try to stop Britain from wasting so much food, clothing and recyclable material by challenging the UK's biggest retailers to give more of their surplus food to charity, and joins an illicit midnight raid to see what can be found in supermarkets' bins. Hugh also tries to help struggling British farmers by forcing the supermarkets to relax their cosmetic standards on fruit and vegetables and continues with his rubbish revolution in Prestwich, Greater Manchester.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5e/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6b/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/aa/Hugh-s-War-on-Waste-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3043 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 2\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06nzl5q","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5fc1ff648495d3520178a1624446a77b9a3013a","amp;dn":"BBC+Hughs+War+On+Waste+Series+1+1of2+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5fc1ff648495d3520178a1624446a77b9a3013a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,252,31,246,72,73,93,53,32,23,138,22,36,68,106,119,185,163,1,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
