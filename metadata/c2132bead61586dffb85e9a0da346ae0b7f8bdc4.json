It's a place rigged with hundreds of social landmines, not the least of which are morons, wedgies, swirlies, bullies, lunchtime banishment to the cafeteria floor - and a festering piece of cheese with nuclear cooties.\nTo survive the never-ending ordeal and attain the recognition and status he feels he so richly deserves, Greg devises an endless series of can't-miss schemes, all of which, of course, go awry. And he's getting it all down on paper, via a diary - &quot;it's NOT a diary, it's a journal!&quot; Greg insists,\npreferring the less-sissyfied designation - filled with his opinions, thoughts, tales of family trials and tribulations, and (would-be) schoolyard triumphs. &quot;One day when I'm famous,&quot; writes Greg, &quot;I'll have better things to do than answer peoples' stupid questions all day.&quot; So was born the Wimpy Kid's diary.\n\n\nContainer: Audio Video Interleave (.AVI)\nVideo Codec Type: H264\nVideo Codec Name: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 938 Kbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass\nResolution: 640 x 344\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 1.860\nQuality Factor (Pixel*Frame): 0.178\nSize: 621 MiB (89%)\n\nAudio Codec: MP3\nBitrate: 112 Kbps\nBitrate Type: Constant\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz\nChannels: 2 Channels : Front - L &amp; R\nSize: 74.1 MiB (11%)\n\n\n\nLanguage English\nSubtitles: English\nTotal Size 701 MB\nInfo Hash: C2132BEAD61586DFFB85E9A0DA346AE0B7F8BDC4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2132bead61586dffb85e9a0da346ae0b7f8bdc4","amp;dn":"Diary+of+a+Wimpy+Kid+2010+DvDrip+MXMG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2132bead61586dffb85e9a0da346ae0b7f8bdc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,19,43,234,214,21,134,223,251,133,233,160,218,52,106,224,183,248,189,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
