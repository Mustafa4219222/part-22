I had just returned from Vietnam in August and went to the Paradox in Tustin, CA, where a bunch of us folkies and singer/songwriters would get together for an open mic. Jack was there. It was early evening and we went out back behind the club and shared a smoke together. I remember walking down the dark alley next to Jack and looking up at the neon blue sky with an early silver moon riding high and thinking &quot;this is good.&quot; - Penny Nichols\n\nThe CD includes renditions of 12 favorite Jackson Browne songs from one of his oldest friends accompanied by many who have sung and played with Jackson over the years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e9a9d840b0f01dede6379be1990c55176fc3a58","amp;dn":"Penny+Nichols+-+Colors+of+the+Sun+%5B2012%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e9a9d840b0f01dede6379be1990c55176fc3a58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,154,157,132,11,15,1,222,222,99,121,190,25,144,197,81,118,252,58,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
