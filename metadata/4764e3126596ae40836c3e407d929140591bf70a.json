A blistering character study and an examination of the American melting pot and the judicial system that keeps it in check, Twelve Angry Men holds at its core a deeply patriotic belief in the U.S. legal system. The story's focal point, known only as Juror Eight, is at first the sole holdout in an 11-1 guilty vote. Eight sets his sights not on proving the other jurors wrong but rather on getting them to look at the situation in a clear-eyed way not affected by their personal biases. Rose deliberately and carefully peels away the layers of artifice from the men and allows a fuller picture of America, at its best and worst, to form.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4764e3126596ae40836c3e407d929140591bf70a","amp;dn":"12+Angry+Men+by+Twelve+Angry+Men+book+by+Reginald+Rose+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4764e3126596ae40836c3e407d929140591bf70a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,100,227,18,101,150,174,64,131,108,62,64,125,146,145,64,89,27,247,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
