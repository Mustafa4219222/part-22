Track listing was:\n\nBayside:\n\n   1. &quot;I Will Follow You Into The Dark&quot; (Death Cab for Cutie Cover)\n\nI Am the Avalanche:\n\n   2. &quot;Drinking Song&quot;\n\nI couldn&amp;#039;t find this song anywhere to download so i used the site imeem and a freecorder to get it myself. It may say it is at 320 kb but i have no clue what it is. The freecorder recorded at 320 kb but it all depends on the original that i was recording from.\n\nTiming is great in my opinion, they started at the same time and ended simultaneously as well. Tell me if you like it, and seed please please please, my bandwidth kinda sucks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32b752121134592fb967341193cc612cd0cdc9b","amp;dn":"Bayside+%5C%22I+Will+Follow+You+Into+The+Dark%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32b752121134592fb967341193cc612cd0cdc9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,43,117,33,33,19,69,146,251,150,115,65,25,60,198,18,205,12,220,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
