Grace and her best friend Judith go for a ride with their horses, but a terrible accident changes her life forever. A truck hits them, Judith and her horse are killed, while Grace and her horse Pilgrim are seriously injured, both physically and mentally. In an attempt to bring Pilgrim back from his now savage condition, Grace&amp;#039;s mother Annie takes them to Montana in search for Tom Booker. Tom is a &quot;horse whisperer&quot;, a cowboy with the ability to &quot;communicate&quot; with horses. In the land of the Wild West Annie will change the way she sees life forever, as the wise cowboy slowly heals the souls of Pilgrim and Grace...\nWritten by Chris Makrozahopoulos\n\n\nC O M M E N T S\n\nTypically brilliant Reford film., 19 August 2005\n\nAuthor: InvisibleSwordsman from United States \n\nAs with every film directed by Robert Redford, &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; is beautifully acted, masterfully directed piece of cinematic poetry. Redford even manages to do what no other actor/director ever has or probably ever will - direct himself in a love story without becoming self-indulgent.\n\nAlong with the uniformly excellent cast, Redford&amp;#039;s direction and Richard LaGravenese&amp;#039;s script, special mention must be made of Robert Richardson&amp;#039;s cinematography - some of the most breathtaking Hollywood has ever seen.\n\nRedford is truly one of the giants of American cinema.\n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e19210794af3bff644acfa7c379a02ccddf0cdfb","amp;dn":"The+Horse+Whisperer%5B1998%5DDvDrip%5B632x436%5DAC3%5B6ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e19210794af3bff644acfa7c379a02ccddf0cdfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,146,16,121,74,243,191,246,68,172,250,124,55,154,2,204,221,240,205,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
