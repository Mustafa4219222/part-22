Oak Knoll Books, 2004.\n\nISBN: 9781584561125 | 232 pages | PDF\n\nJohn Carter's ABC for Book Collectors has long been established as the most enjoyable as well as the most informative reference book on the subject. Here, in over 490 alphabetical entries, ranging in length from a single line to several pages, may be found definition and analysis of the technical terms used in book collecting and bibliography, interspersed with salutary comments on such subjects as auctions, condition, facsimiles and fakes, &quot;points&quot;, rarity, etc. \n\nThis eighth edition has been revised by Nicolas Barker, editor of The Book Collector and incorporates additional words created by the introduction of web-based collecting. ABC for Book Collectors retains its humorous character as the one indispensable guide to book collecting while also keeping us up-to-date with modern terminology.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b788f4129341f0d44bf47208dcadaf7f3cbc47","amp;dn":"Carter+and+Barker%3A+ABC+for+Book+Collectors%2C+8th+edn.+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b788f4129341f0d44bf47208dcadaf7f3cbc47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,183,136,244,18,147,65,240,212,75,244,114,8,220,173,175,127,60,188,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
