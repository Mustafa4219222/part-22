It was this trial and its outcome that put Rumpole on the map and began to shape him into the eccentric and cantankerous defender of justice and reciter of poetry readers know and love. Rumpole and the Penge Bungalow Murders is a must read for every Rumpole fan and a compelling invitation to new readers to get to know Mortimer's addictive barrister.\n\n\n&quot;Bill Wallis is brilliant as Horace Rumpole, the cantankerous hero of 12 volumes of Mortimer's Wodehousian accounts of life at the Old Bailey. In this entry, Rumpole is writing his memoirs about his long and irreverent career, beginning with his first case, the Penge Bungalow murders....Wallis's Rumpole sounds just as he should as he narrates his memoir: gruff, wistful, funny, sly, and infuriatingly lovable. ...Listeners will be sorely tempted to listen to this in one sitting and will be disappointed when it ends.&quot;\nAudioFile\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc6f78eda833aa825ca80d7fe56a76931258d836","amp;dn":"Rumpole+of+the+Bailey+-+The+Penge+Bungalow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc6f78eda833aa825ca80d7fe56a76931258d836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,111,120,237,168,51,170,130,92,168,13,127,229,106,118,147,18,88,216,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
