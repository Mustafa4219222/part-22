Not all amplifiers used in instrumentation\napplications are instrumentation amplifiers, and by no means are all in-amps used only in instrumentation applications. In-amps are used in many applications, from motor control to data acquisition to automotive. The intent of this guide is to explain the fundamentals of what an instrumentation amplifier is, how it operates, and how and where to use it. In addition, several different categories of instrumentation amplifiers are addressed in this guide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ec735728e20f077a8aa37458c79b8ebe24b813e","amp;dn":"+A+Designers+Guide+to+Instrumentation+Amps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ec735728e20f077a8aa37458c79b8ebe24b813e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,199,53,114,142,32,240,119,168,170,55,69,140,121,184,235,226,75,129,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
