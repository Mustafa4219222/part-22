Gillis and Mike Saenz, and published by First Comics.  \n\nShatter appeared simultaneously as a one-shot special and as a backup feature in First ComicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Jon Sable title in 1985. It was then published in its own 14-issue series from 1985-1988.\n\nShatter was the first commercially published all-digital comic, i.e. a comic for which the art was created entirely on the computer; as opposed to what later became the common method of drawing on board with pencil, pen and ink and then scanning the black and white art into a computer for the application of computer color.\n\nThe Shatter artwork was initially drawn on a first-generation Apple Macintosh using a mouse, and printed out on an Apple Dot-maytix ImageWriter. The print-outs were then photographed like a piece of traditionally drawn black-and-white comic art and the color separations were applied in the traditional manner for comics at the time. This is almost the reverse of the current method of drawing comics on board and scanning the art into a computer for the application of color in computer graphics programs.\n\nArtist Mike Saenz left after the first couple of issues of the full Shatter title. (Saenz went on to create Iron Man: Crash, the first digital graphic novel, in 1988; and Donna Matrix, a digital graphic novel utilizing 3-D rendering, in 1993.) He was replaced for several issues by artists who worked in the traditional manner, although the artwork was then digitized.\n\nArtist Charlie Athanas re-established the standard of creating the comic directly on the computer. He drew the pages with a mouse on a Macintosh Plus computer.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c9d21f2015d88183785d2961a6d2a780528df5f","amp;dn":"Shatter+%28First+Digital+Comic%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c9d21f2015d88183785d2961a6d2a780528df5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,157,33,242,1,93,136,24,55,133,210,150,26,109,42,120,5,40,223,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
