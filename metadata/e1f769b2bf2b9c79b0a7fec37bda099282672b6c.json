Tracks 1-9 are in stereo &amp; tracks 10-18 in mono.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow\nTaken from a Jazz at the Philharmonic tour, Ella Fitzgerald is backed by pianist Oscar Peterson, guitarist Herb Ellis, bassist Ray Brown, and drummer Jo Jones on two well-rounded sets. Actually, the two dates are quite similar, with eight of the nine songs being repeated (although the second &quot;Stompin' at the Savoy&quot; and &quot;Oh, Lady Be Good&quot; find her backed by a riffing eight-horn all-star group), so this album is mostly recommended to her greatest fans. However, the music is wonderful, there are variations between the different versions, and her voice was at its prime. \n\nTracks 1-16 Ella with:\nOscar Peterson - Piano\nHerb Ellis - Guitar\nRay Brown - Bass\nJo Jones - Drums\n\nTracks 17-18 Ella with:\nRoy Eldridge - Trumpet\nJ.
