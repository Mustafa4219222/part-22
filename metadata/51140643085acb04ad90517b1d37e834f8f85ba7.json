Lots on banking fraud, war profiteers and collaborators.  It kinda jumps the timeline a little (out of necessity) and has a full 3 minutes of identical footage from episode 1 but is still worth every minute.\n\nThese two prequels do well to point out the Americans who spoke out against the evils of the empire early on.\n\nPlease support Stone and Kuznick - heck, subscribe to Showtime for running with this!  If you don't have a BR player and $30 to get the set, buy the book or audiobook.  It is much more thorough and well worth it.\n\nBravo Stone &amp; Kuznick!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51140643085acb04ad90517b1d37e834f8f85ba7","amp;dn":"Oliver+Stone%27s+Untold+History+of+the+United+States+-+PREQUEL+A+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51140643085acb04ad90517b1d37e834f8f85ba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,20,6,67,8,90,203,4,173,144,81,123,29,55,232,52,248,248,91,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
