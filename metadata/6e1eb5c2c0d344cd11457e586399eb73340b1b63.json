In Domain-Specific Languages, noted software development expert Martin Fowler first provides the information software professionals need to decide if and when to utilize DSLs. Then, where DSLs prove suitable, Fowler presents effective techniques for building them, and guides software engineers in choosing the right approaches for their applications.\n\nThis bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s techniques may be utilized with most modern object-oriented languages; the author provides numerous examples in Java and C#, as well as selected examples in Ruby. Wherever possible, chapters are organized to be self-standing, and most reference topics are presented in a familiar patterns format.\n\nArmed with this wide-ranging book, developers will have the knowledge they need to make important decisions about DSLsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, where appropriate, gain the significant technical and business benefits they offer.\n\n \n\nThe topics covered include:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢      How DSLs compare to frameworks and libraries, and when those alternatives are sufficient\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢      Using parsers and parser generators, and parsing external DSLs\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢      Understanding, comparing, and choosing DSL language constructs\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢      Determining whether to use code generation, and comparing code generation strategies\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢      Previewing new language workbench tools for creating DSLs\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 640 pages\n# Publisher: Addison-Wesley Professional; 1 edition (October 3, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321712943\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321712943","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e1eb5c2c0d344cd11457e586399eb73340b1b63","amp;dn":"Domain-Specific+Languages%2C1st+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e1eb5c2c0d344cd11457e586399eb73340b1b63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,30,181,194,192,211,68,205,17,69,126,88,99,153,235,115,52,11,27,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
