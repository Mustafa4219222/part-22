Uninstall any other version of Sygic, delete Aura folder and reboot.\n\n2. Install 11.2.6 and select any map to download. Interrupt download after a few kb completed.\n\n3. Check the folder. Aura shows only database.xml file.\n\n4. Copy contents of Aura folder from your PC including the base files (~ 292 mb) into /sdcard/Aura and maps into /sdcard/Aura/maps.\n\n5. Restart application. Start page shows maps to select, select continue without selecting any maps. Program downloads another 130mb and works.\n\nSteps above are required if you get prolonged &quot;loading configuration files&quot; message. If you don't get that message, just copy the base files (Aura folder) to sdcard and maps into /sdcard/aura/maps and you are good to go.\n\nMaps included are 100% for India.
