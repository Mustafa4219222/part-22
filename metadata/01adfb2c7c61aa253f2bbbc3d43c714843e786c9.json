Across eight episodes, James embarks on a thrilling adventure through the rich Irish landscape. He explores his homeland and personally guides viewers through Irish life, touching on its culture, history, people and visiting places close to his heart along the way.\n\nThroughout the series James engages with Irish people from all walks of life, as he provides a fresh perspective on iconic landmarks such as the GiantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Causeway and natural wonders like the Black Cliffs of Moher, as well as less well-known places of interest including the traditional seaweed baths at Strandhill.\n\nEpisode 2\nThis week, James takes a look at the people who have got the work/life balance just right. He experiences life on the ocean wave in County Clare with John McCarthy, one of Ireland's top surfers, and visits a relaxed family smokery in beautiful Connemara.
