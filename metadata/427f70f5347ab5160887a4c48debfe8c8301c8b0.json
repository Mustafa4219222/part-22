Horace Ott's string arrangements are \n\noverbearing in scope and undernourished in tone; at times they don't even seem in sync with Benson's group.  The big band \n\ntracks -- &quot;Song For My Father&quot; in particular -- are more tolerable, and the gospel singing of the Sweet Inspirations is harmless.  \n\nThere is one high-spirited Benson vocal, &quot;That Lucky Old Sun,&quot; and it strikes fire.  Perversely perhaps, the choice cut is a \n\nsurprisingly hard-driven &quot;Windmills Of Your Mind,&quot; in which Benson fights off the cheesy arrangement with some powerfully \n\nrhythmic work ( watch out for the shattering psychedelic ending! ). ~ Richard S.
