Crime is rife, especially drugs and drug violence. A Russian thug is building his heroin trade, while everyone laughs at the cops. Brothers have chosen different paths: Joe has followed his father Bert into New York's Finest; he's a rising star. Bobby, who uses his mother's maiden name, manages a club. Bobby too is on the rise: he has a new girlfriend and a green-light to develop a Manhattan club. Joe and Bert ask him to help with intelligence gathering; he declines. Then, Joe raids Bobby's club to arrest the Russian. From there, things spiral out of control: the Russian puts out a hit on Joe, personal losses mount, and Bobby's loyalties face the test.\n\n\nLanguages: English / Russian\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf3ef2a3789a6b47388103b01923b51bb29ea37","amp;dn":"We+Own+The+Night+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf3ef2a3789a6b47388103b01923b51bb29ea37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,243,239,42,55,137,166,180,115,136,16,59,1,146,59,81,187,41,234,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
