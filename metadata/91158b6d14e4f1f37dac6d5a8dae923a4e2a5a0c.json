D's Winter Crazy Dub (9:13) 8.9 MB\n2.  D's Winter Outtake   (5:43) 5.5 MB\ncover.jpg\n\nThis torrent contains the Tortoise 12-inch of remixes by Derrick Carter.  Both remixes are of the track &quot;In Sarah, Menken, Christ, and Beethoven There Were Women and Men,&quot; from the TNT album.  I transferred the tracks from vinyl into Pro Tools, bounced the tracks down to .wav, and then created the mp3's from the .wav files.  Sorry, I originally created 128 kbps mp3's and I don't have access to the .wav files at the moment to create a higher quality rip.  If anyone is interested in a higher bitrate version, leave a comment and I'll try to upload a better rip later when I get access to the .wav.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91158b6d14e4f1f37dac6d5a8dae923a4e2a5a0c","amp;dn":"Tortoise+-+Derrick+Carter+12-inch+%28remixes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91158b6d14e4f1f37dac6d5a8dae923a4e2a5a0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,21,139,109,20,228,241,243,125,172,109,90,141,174,146,58,78,42,90,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
