This book describes the set of XML core classes in .NET, introduces the .NET XML parsing model and how to program against it, and discusses XML readers and writers and XMLDOM. It examines related technologies such as schemas, transformations, and XPath, and it discusses data issues such as synchronization and serialization, the DiffGram format, and the XML extensions in Microsoft SQL Server 2000. This Microsoft Press title also reveals how to get the best performance from XML with .NET, and it offers in-depth information on interoperability topics such as when to use XML Web services and when to use remoting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4780e9b625310d264a69aa5eb16870ed425efbc4","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2002%5D+Applied+XML+Programming+for+Microsoft+.NET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4780e9b625310d264a69aa5eb16870ed425efbc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,128,233,182,37,49,13,38,74,105,170,94,177,104,112,237,66,94,251,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
