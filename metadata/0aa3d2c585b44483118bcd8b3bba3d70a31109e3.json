Yet the man that monopolized the British press during five tumultuous years as England manager remains an enigma. Who, precisely, is Sven?\n\nHere, in his no-holds-barred autobiography, the secretive Swede takes us on one of the wildest rides in world football. Populated by fake sheikhs, Italian lawyers, Nottingham outlaws and, of course, many of the biggest names in the game, his is a 40-year-long career that coincides with the evolution of football into a global multibillion-pound industry.\n\nMost of all, this is a surprisingly tender, sometimes heartbreaking, but never bitter account of a simple man with a most complicated story. A man who has reached a crossroads in his life, who until now has never stopped to ask himself the question: was it worth it?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0aa3d2c585b44483118bcd8b3bba3d70a31109e3","amp;dn":"Sven+-+My+Story+-+Sven-G%26ouml%3Bran+Eriksson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0aa3d2c585b44483118bcd8b3bba3d70a31109e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,163,210,197,133,180,68,131,17,139,205,139,59,186,61,112,163,17,9,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
