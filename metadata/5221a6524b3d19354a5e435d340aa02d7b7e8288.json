From the Plantagenets to the Tudors, from the Hanovers \nto the Winsors, Wanda McCaddon delivers these short, straightforward \nbiographies with proper English pride, deference, and oftentimes, a \nsly sense of irony. The names and dates come fast and furiously, but \nhere are a few facts: Over half of France was in England&amp;#039;s possession \nduring the reign of Henry II. Richard III was the last English monarch \nto die on the battlefield. And, as a 19-year-old princess, Queen Elizabeth \nII joined the Auxiliary Transport Service as a mechanic in the final \ndays of WWII. B.P.
