Now, however, things may be about to change. \n\nPitched into the heart of the conflict are four people: Morgan, a veteran warrior charged with an important mission; Cheris, a gifted but wayward sorceress called from her exile on a remote island; Ceriana Hartfield, a noblewoman whose marriage is pre-empted by a chance discovery on a beach; and Cygan, a man from the desolate marshes seeking aid against a merciless foe. \n\nBetween them, could they hold the key to ending this deadly conflict? But at what cost? This extraordinary epic is a gripping, searing tale of the ugliness of war and the dangers of power\n\nGenre: Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7de1bca94393f3de7abda38c1ce478fc3b7310","amp;dn":"The+Forgotten+War+by+Howard+Sargent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7de1bca94393f3de7abda38c1ce478fc3b7310","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,125,225,188,169,67,147,243,222,122,189,163,140,28,228,120,252,59,115,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
