And it definitively reveals how China is steadily pursuing a stealthy, systematic strategy to attain geopolitical and economic dominance first in Asia and Eurasia, then possibly globally, within the next twenty. Using recently declassified documents, statements by Russian and Chinese leaders largely overlooked in the Western media, and groundbreaking analysis and investigative work, Menges explains China's plan thoroughly, exposing:\n\n    China's methods of economic control.\n    China's secret alliance with Russia and other anti-America nations, including North Korea.\n    China's growing military and nuclear power-over 90 ICBMs, many of them aimed at U.S. cities.\n    How China and Russia have been responsible for weaponizing terrorists bent on harming the U.S.\n    Damage caused by China's trade tactics (since 1990, we've lost 8 million jobs thanks to China trade surpluses). \n\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Constantine C. Menges, formerly a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, he passed away in early 2004. He served several years in the White House as special assistant to President Reagan for National Security Affairs and at the CIA as national intelligence officer. Menges frequently testified before the U.S. Congress and is an advisor to members of Congress on international issues and U.S. foreign policy. Menges' articles have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, New Republic, and Washington Times.\n\nHardcover: 554 pages\nPublisher: Thomas Nelson; First Edition edition (April 19, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1595550054\nISBN-13: 978-1595550057\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/China-Gathering-Constantine-Menges-Ph-D/dp/1595550054/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372904922&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=china+the+gathering+threat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/China-Gathering-Constantine-Menges-Ph-D/dp/1595550054/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372904922&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=china+the+gathering+threat&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:408c39c780d2d8e76ef3cb9f97c70c9e02e8a9b5","amp;dn":"China%3A+The+Gathering+Threat++%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"408c39c780d2d8e76ef3cb9f97c70c9e02e8a9b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,140,57,199,128,210,216,231,110,243,203,159,151,199,12,158,2,232,169,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
