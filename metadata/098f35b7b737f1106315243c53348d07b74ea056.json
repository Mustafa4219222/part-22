He was born in Sirunangur, a village in the state of Tamil Nadu. He followed the footsteps of his father Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer who was also a Carnatic singer. Besides studying with his father, he was also a disciple of Melattur Sama Dikshitar. Maharajapuram Santhanam was also a distinguished composer.  Maharajapuram Santhanam took classical carnatic music to people in his melodious style and was marching with vigour and determination winning the hearts of overflowing audiences. Without deviating from the classical style of good quality, he made his recitals highly entertaining. He had a rich repertoire of songs. His mellow presentation, the pieces and rendition of ragas, neravals and swaras had a pleasant style of classicism satisfying common AND elite listeners. The forte of Santhanam's singing technique was the art of communicating profound musical expressions with an easy to absorb simplicity. Towards this end he modulated his voice effectively to stress the nuances of a raga sanchara or to bring out the elegance of the sahitya in a song. In his cutcheris one could not discern the distinction between a wighty song or a thukkada, for he treated each song with consummate embellishment that long after he stopped singing the piece, it lingered in the ears of the listener. Santhanam had a unique style of building up a raga. Vallinam, mellinam of the voice, Karvais and brikhas, meandering and spiriting sangathis were purveyed in such a mix that the hearers felt enthralled. However many times the audience had longed to hear his exposition of Mohanam, Brindavana Saranga, or Kalyana Vasantham! Or how he spiced his performance with a purandara dasa devotional that made the listeners join him in the experience of the Dasakootas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:098f35b7b737f1106315243c53348d07b74ea056","amp;dn":"Maharajapuram+Santhanam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"098f35b7b737f1106315243c53348d07b74ea056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,143,53,183,183,55,241,16,99,21,36,60,83,52,141,7,183,78,160,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
