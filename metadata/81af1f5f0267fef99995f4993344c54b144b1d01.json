To combat these baddies, you have your trusty sword, an axe, and a bow that shoots flaming arrows at the ready. But this game is more than just hack-and-slash action; each level has unique puzzles that differ from stage to stage, giving a nice degree of variety to the title. Also, once a certain number of enemies are dispatched, you can gather up a chalice that gives you access to the Hall of Heroes, a place where heroic ghosts distribute special weapons or items with each visit. Of course, these visits are usually accompanied by a verbal chastising at your unworthy status as the champion of Gallowmere. And while this game has plenty of action, it is also filled with bright and colorful graphics, and has a light feel that will appeal to younger gamers. \n\n\n\nType.................: Game\n\nPlatform.............: PS1\n\nMore Info............: http://psx.ign.com/objects/003/003950.html\n\nImage Format.........: .bin + .cue\n\nImage Created with...: CloneCD\n\nBurn Tested..........: Yes\n\nSpecial CDR..........: Requires 700 MB / 80 Min CDR\n\nPublished by.........: Sony Computer Entertainment\n\nDeveloped by.........: SCE Studios Cambridge / SCEE\n\nGenre................: Action \n\nNumber of Players....: 1\n\nRelease Date.........: October 21, 1998 \n\nFeatures.............: Memory Card, Dual Shock, Vibration ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81af1f5f0267fef99995f4993344c54b144b1d01","amp;dn":"Medievil-PAL+PS1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81af1f5f0267fef99995f4993344c54b144b1d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,175,31,95,2,103,254,249,153,149,244,153,51,68,197,75,20,75,29,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
