At eighteen I started playing professionally at provincial evening shops in Greece. Since then I have played with almost all noteworthy singers, musicians and singers of folk music. \nPreviously, played clarinet in the first known municipal evening shops in Athens, usually from ten in the evening until the morning.\nI am completely self-taught. \nWhat I learned I learned by myself by listening to the radio the old great klarintzides, Karakosta, Karayiannis ...\n                                                    Girgos Maggas (from liner notes)\n\n\n\n01.
