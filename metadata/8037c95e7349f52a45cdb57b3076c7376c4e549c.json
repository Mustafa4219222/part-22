She is non-replaceable, important, essential, but after serving her mandatory Breeding Duty, the impregnation and birthing that all women are obligated to undergo, her life loses purpose as she privately mourns the child she will never be permitted to know.\n\nWhen Policeman Leonard Barrens enlists her and her hacking skills in the unofficial investigation of his mentor's violent death, Dempsey finds herself increasingly captivated by both the case and Barrens himself. According to Information Security, the missing man has simply &quot;Retired&quot;, nothing unusual. Together they follow the trail left by the mutilated remains. Their investigation takes them through lost dataspaces and deep into the uninhabited regions of the ship, where they discover that the answer may not be as simple as a serial killer after all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8037c95e7349f52a45cdb57b3076c7376c4e549c","amp;dn":"David+Ramirez+-+The+Forever+Watch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8037c95e7349f52a45cdb57b3076c7376c4e549c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,55,201,94,115,73,245,42,69,205,181,123,48,118,199,55,108,78,84,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
