Hosting a dinner party is hard, but Corey Mintz can help. For his popular Toronto Star column, &quot;Fed,&quot; he has presided over 115 dinner parties, every week opening his home to strangers and friends alike in an effort to perfect the craft of hosting. And in How to Host a Dinner Party, he shares everything he's learned in a hilarious handbook that will appeal to everyone Ã¢â‚¬â€ from those throwing their first dinner party to seasoned entertainers looking to enhance their skills.\n\nThis book guides readers through everything they need to know about hosting, starting with the golden rule Ã¢â‚¬â€ that the goal of a dinner party is to have fun with our friends, not to show off our cooking skills. It will explain why we like to gather for dinner, when we should host, who we should invite, what we should cook, and how we should cook it. Featuring recipes, anecdotes, expert analysis, and an endless bounty of how-to tips, it is the essential guide to perfecting the art of welcoming people into your home.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1601e0d65c56fafb80e77d60b145d2895c6bbf8","amp;dn":"How+to+Host+a+Dinner+Party+-+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1601e0d65c56fafb80e77d60b145d2895c6bbf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,96,30,13,101,197,111,175,184,14,119,214,11,20,93,40,149,198,187,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
