No need to worry, as some people do, whether a cat can be both dead and alive, whether the moon is there when nobody looks at it, or whether quantum systems need an observer to acquire definite properties. The authorâ€™s inimitable and even humorous style makes the book a pleasure to read while bringing a new clarity to many of the longstanding puzzles of quantum physics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:905fc96c7435806f44d96d6a2daa12229dcc787a","amp;dn":"Making+Sense+of+Quantum+Mechanics+-+Jean+Bricmont","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"905fc96c7435806f44d96d6a2daa12229dcc787a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,95,201,108,116,53,128,111,68,217,109,106,45,170,18,34,157,204,120,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
