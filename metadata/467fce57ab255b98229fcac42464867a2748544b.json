Robert's daughter Joan was the executive producer. 12 episodes were broadcast, from January 2, 1988 until April 9, 1988 on CBS, before the show was cancelled. The series also had a spin-off titled Jesse Hawkes.\n\nThe series was centered around Jesse Hawkes, an ex-Marine who started the High Mountain Rangers 35 years before the pilot. He retired after hauling his long-time nemesis, murderous criminal mastermind T.J. Cousins, to justice. Spared the death penalty on a legal technicality, Cousins instead was given life imprisonment without eligibility for parole. Meanwhile, Jesse's eldest son Matt tries out for the HMRs and eventually becomes the team's #2 Ranger...after Merlin, who has succeeded Jesse as director. Then Cousins gets broken out of jail by his hoods, and fatally ambushes Merlin. Now, as the team's third director, Matt urges his father out of retirement to help the Rangers recapture Cousins.\n\nList of episodes\n\n\n\n    The Only Place To Live - January 2, 1988\n\n    Old Friends, New Friends - January 9, 1988\n    Accused Of Murder - January 16, 1988 - Jesse stands trial for the killing of his longtime nemesis T.J.
