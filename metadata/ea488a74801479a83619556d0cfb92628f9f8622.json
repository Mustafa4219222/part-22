Inventions is a collaboration between Temporary Services,a group based in Chicago, and Angelo, \nwho is incarcerated in California. Angelo illustrated and described many incredible inventions made by prisoners. \nThe creations include cooking appliances, cigarette lighters, condoms and chess sets. \nThese items often fill needs that are not addressed within the usual restrictions of the prison environment. \nTemporary Services co-edited a book of Angelo?s writings and drawings, re-created many of the inventions from the book, \nand built a full-size replica of Angelo?s cell at his request.\n\nRead more about Temporary Services and Prisoners&amp;#039; Inventions: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.temporaryservices.org/pi_overview.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.temporaryservices.org/pi_overview.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea488a74801479a83619556d0cfb92628f9f8622","amp;dn":"Prisoners+Inventions+-+ART+BOOK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea488a74801479a83619556d0cfb92628f9f8622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,72,138,116,128,20,121,168,54,25,85,109,12,251,146,98,143,159,134,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
