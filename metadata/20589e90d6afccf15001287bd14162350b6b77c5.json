Dylan Hunt, captain of the starship Andromeda, betrayed by his allies, was frozen in time and awoke three centuries later to find the Commonweath had fallen. To fight back the chaos among the stars, Hunt must use the Andromeda to restore the Commonwealth and bring unity to the galaxy once again. He recruits a mercenary, Tyr Anasazi, and the crew of the Eureka Maru: Captain Beka Valentine, Engineer Seamus Harper, Physicist Rev Bem, and Medical Officer Trance Gemini. \n\nAfter discovering the Spirit of the Abyss and its powerful weapon, the Magog Worldship, the need for the Commonwealth is greater than ever. 50 member worlds are finally recruited, and the reconstruction of the Commonwealth is finally truly underway. More and more worlds sign on, contributing their fleets to protect each other. \n\n\nSeason 2  \n23. 2-1 201 01-Oct-2001   The Widening Gyre (2) \n24. 2-2 202 08-Oct-2001   Exit Strategies \n25. 2-3 203 15-Oct-2001   A Heart for Falsehood Framed \n26. 2-4 209 22-Oct-2001   Pitiless as the Sun \n27. 2-5 206 29-Oct-2001   Last Call at the Broken Hammer \n28. 2-6 204 05-Nov-2001   All Too Human \n29. 2-7 207 12-Nov-2001   Una Salus Victus \n30. 2-8 205 19-Nov-2001   Home Fires \n31. 2-9 208 26-Nov-2001   Into the Labyrinth \n32. 2-10 210 19-Jan-2002   The Prince \n33. 2-11 211 26-Jan-2002   Bunker Hill \n34. 2-12 212 02-Feb-2002   Ouroborous \n35. 2-13 213 09-Feb-2002   Lava and Rockets \n36. 2-14 216 16-Feb-2002   Be All My Sins Remembered \n37. 2-15 214 23-Feb-2002   Dance of the Mayflies \n38. 2-16 215 02-Mar-2002   In Heaven Now Are Three \n39. 2-17 221 13-Apr-2002   The Things We Cannot Change \n40. 2-18 217 20-Apr-2002   The Fair Unknown \n41. 2-19 219 27-Apr-2002   Belly of the Beast \n42. 2-20 218 04-May-2002   The Knight, Death, and the Devil \n43. 2-21 220 11-May-2002   Immaculate Perception \n44. 2-22 222 18-May-2002   The Tunnel at the End of the Light \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20589e90d6afccf15001287bd14162350b6b77c5","amp;dn":"Andromeda.Complete.Season2.DVDRip.DivX-TyR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20589e90d6afccf15001287bd14162350b6b77c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,88,158,144,214,175,204,241,80,1,40,123,209,65,98,53,11,107,119,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
