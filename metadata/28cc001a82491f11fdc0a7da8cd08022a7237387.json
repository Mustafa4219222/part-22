The\r\ncourse teaches you how to use the SFML library for\r\nC++, to start working with graphics, events and\r\nsound to create a 2D game. Everything is done step\r\nby step with the help of videos, so it's easy to\r\nfollow along and learn. At the end of the course you will know\r\nwhat you need for game programming and will be able to start\r\nmaking your own games\r\n\r\nWarning: This course was published more than 2 years ago and\r\nthe technology used in it progresses fast. The current most\r\nupdated version of SFML (2.1) doesn't work out of the box with\r\nVisual Studio 2013 (or the express editions) and it requires more\r\nwork to setup. If you want to follow this course\r\neasily, then you should use the 2012 or older\r\nversion of Visual Studio (or the express edition)\r\nwhich can still be officially downloaded from\r\nMicrosoft site","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28cc001a82491f11fdc0a7da8cd08022a7237387","amp;dn":"Udemy+Learn+C+Plus+Plus+Game+Development+Tutorial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28cc001a82491f11fdc0a7da8cd08022a7237387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,204,0,26,130,73,31,17,253,192,167,218,140,208,128,34,167,35,115,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
