Blundell, Katherine M. Blundell \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 516 pages \r\nPublisher: Oxford University Press; 2 edition (November 30, 2009) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 978-0199562091 \r\n\r\n\r\nAn understanding of thermal physics is crucial to much of modern physics, chemistry and engineering. This book provides a modern introduction to the main principles that are foundational to thermal physics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. The key concepts are carefully presented in a clear way, and new ideas are illustrated with copious worked examples as well as a description of the historical background to their discovery. Applications are presented to subjects as diverse as stellar astrophysics, information and communication theory, condensed matter physics and climate change. Each chapter concludes with detailed exercises.\r\n\r\nThe second edition of this popular textbook maintains the structure and lively style of the first edition but extends its coverage of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics to include several new topics, including osmosis, diffusion problems, Bayes theorem, radiative transfer, the Ising model and Monte Carlo methods. New examples and exercises have been added throughout","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a264362056603ced3c55e4f2145a6cf3d661349c","amp;dn":"Concepts+in+Thermal+Physics%2C+2nd+Edition+%5B2009%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a264362056603ced3c55e4f2145a6cf3d661349c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,100,54,32,86,96,60,237,60,85,228,242,20,90,108,243,214,97,52,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
