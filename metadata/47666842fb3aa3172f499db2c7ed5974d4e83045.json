The double-album 1962-1966, commonly called the &amp;quot;Red Album,&amp;quot; does the job surprisingly well, hitting most of the group's major early hits and adding important album tracks like &amp;quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Drive My Car,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Norwegian Wood,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;In My Life.&amp;quot; Naturally, there are many great songs missing from the 26-track 1962-1966, and perhaps it would have made more sense to include the Revolver cuts on its companion volume, 1967-1970, yet the Red Album captures the essence of the Beatles' pre-Sgt. Pepper records. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47666842fb3aa3172f499db2c7ed5974d4e83045","amp;dn":"Beatles+1962-1966+%28Red+Album%29+%40192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47666842fb3aa3172f499db2c7ed5974d4e83045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,102,104,66,251,58,163,23,47,73,157,178,199,237,89,116,212,232,48,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
