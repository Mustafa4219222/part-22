He initially encounters three children that he at first finds it difficult to interact with but later realises that two of them remind him of his team-mates Naruto and Sakura. He has several flashbacks of their time together and the bonds they share. In the end he uses the doors of a destroyed house and paints a mural of Team 7, along with Sasuke, holding hands.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bf1b8a89c6cd38044ec1cbaf34ddd067c91a20c","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+238+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bf1b8a89c6cd38044ec1cbaf34ddd067c91a20c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,241,184,168,156,108,211,128,68,236,28,186,243,77,221,6,124,145,162,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
