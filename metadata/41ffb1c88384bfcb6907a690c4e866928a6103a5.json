This is one of director Louis Malle's finest films: others include The Fire Within and Au Revoir Les Enfants. Laurent (Benoit Ferreux) is 14 years old and anxious to lose his virginity. However, he has a very close family circle, and, between the family and school, he is too closely watched to get anywhere. He makes the most of an opportunity to neck with the girls at his older brothers' party and later almost gets to lose his virginity in a bordello, but his boisterously drunken brothers interrupt him. His real opportunity arises while his mother takes him for a rest-cure for his heart murmur at a very conventional spa.\n\n\n   General\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 1645 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 14.3 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 0/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 1557 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.263\n      StreamSize : 1.29 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 58mn\n      Bit rate : 79 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 67.0 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.93 \n      Encoding settings : VBR (mtrh)\n\nVideo split in two files, with matching subtitles\n\nFrench audio, English subpack, English, Spanish and Portuguese srt subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0067778\n\nPosted at Karagarga by evilstein","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ffb1c88384bfcb6907a690c4e866928a6103a5","amp;dn":"Louis+Malle+-+Le+souffle+au+coeur+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ffb1c88384bfcb6907a690c4e866928a6103a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,255,177,200,131,132,191,203,105,7,166,144,196,232,102,146,138,97,3,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
