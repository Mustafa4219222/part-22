Also included is a set of  Clerestory and Just Trains Mk1 coaches, both with passenger view.\n \n12 exciting custom scenarios (including some that require additional routes) complete the package!\n \nThe 'City of Truro' locomotive would become famous on May 9, 1904 when it was timed at 102.3 MPH while descending the 1-in-86 Whiteball bank with the Ã¢â‚¬ËœOcean MailsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ parcel service. The accuracy of this speed has been questioned and investigated a number of times, but the loco was certainly travelling in excess of 98 MPH when it passed Milepost 171 near Wellington in Somerset! If we believe the recording of Charles Rous-Marten it is certain that 3440 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of TruroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was the first steam locomotive to reach 100 MPH anywhere in the world. We have included a scenario to see if you can also get to this magic number!\n\nLOCOMOTIVES\n \n\n    3440 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of TruroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 2004-2006 version\n    3700 Ã¢â‚¬ËœDurbanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n    3704 Ã¢â‚¬ËœLytteltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n    3710 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of BathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n    3716 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n    3717 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of TruroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (2010-2012)\n    3717 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of TruroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (1912-1931)\n    3719 Ã¢â‚¬ËœCity of ExeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nCOACHES\n\nJust Trains Mk1 coaches in brown and cream livery: Brake Standard Open, First Open, Tourist Standard Open\n\nClerestory coaches: Corridor Compartment, Corridor third, Right-hand brake coach, Left-hand brake coach\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nFor questions, support and requests join here:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nemail for support:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;4c38292d21383c2e78293a293e0c2b212d2520622f2321&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1624a2d44e987ac8170ba9ea74e8dbc5d836311","amp;dn":"+Railworks+4+Class+3700+with+%27City+of+Truro%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1624a2d44e987ac8170ba9ea74e8dbc5d836311","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,98,74,45,68,233,135,172,129,112,186,158,167,78,141,188,93,131,99,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
