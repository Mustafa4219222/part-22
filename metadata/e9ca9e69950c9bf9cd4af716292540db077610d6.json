It follows a handful of characters as they brave their way across a country ravaged by a plague and the subsequent downfall of society.\n\nThis tale would garner an 'R' rating if it were a movie, so, if you're easily offended, you may want to skip it.\n\nAt the end of the first segment of this tale is a link to the following segments on amazon Books. They are listed at $0.99. If you don't want to pay for them because you're short on cash (I know the feeling, so no shame there), just shoot me an email and I'll send you the following segments free of charge. My email can be found on the Amazon Books page linked at the end of the first segment of this tale.\n\nThis torrent will contain the first segment of 'A Pale Horse' as both a mobi and a PDF file.\n\nHappy reading.\n\nPeeeeeeeeeace!\n\n\nAdam Wolf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9ca9e69950c9bf9cd4af716292540db077610d6","amp;dn":"A+Pale+Horse+-+Part%3A+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9ca9e69950c9bf9cd4af716292540db077610d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,202,158,105,149,12,155,249,205,74,247,22,41,37,64,219,7,118,16,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
