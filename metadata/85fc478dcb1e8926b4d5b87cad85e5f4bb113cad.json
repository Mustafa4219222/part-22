There are traditional employees (those with salaries, benefits, regulated work and hours) and non-traditional (contingent) employees who are not employed full-time due to other priorities they have in life.\n\nThis book takes a closer look at the white-collar workforce, and, more specifically, knowledge workers who work on a project basis without tying themselves to traditional employerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“employee relationships. \n  \nThese 'freelancer workers possess a tremendous amount of knowledge, skill and ability. If the firms that employ them on a project basis wish to retain them in the long run, they must reconsider their HRM strategies, especially in terms of recruitment, retention and motivation.\n\nIn short, the main theme of this book is about identifying, defining and implementing talent management strategies for effective management of non-traditional knowledge employees in an organization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fc478dcb1e8926b4d5b87cad85e5f4bb113cad","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+%5B2010%5D+Talent+Management+of+Knowledge+Workers+Embracing+t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85fc478dcb1e8926b4d5b87cad85e5f4bb113cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,252,71,141,203,30,137,38,180,213,184,124,173,133,229,244,187,17,60,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
