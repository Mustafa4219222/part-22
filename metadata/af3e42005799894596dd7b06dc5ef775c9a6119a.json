Six of the eight runners have since tested\n positive for banned substances. Ben Johnson, the winner, received\n a career destroying ban, whilst his rival, Carl Lewis, had failed three \n drug tests prior to the competition, and British runner Linford Christie, \n who finished second, was eventually banned for a series of drug test \n failures. In this program, Johnson and other runners will tell their\n personal stories of the race, and also put into context how and why\n athletes become drug cheats. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af3e42005799894596dd7b06dc5ef775c9a6119a","amp;dn":"The.Race.That.Shocked.The.World.HDTV.x264-W4F.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af3e42005799894596dd7b06dc5ef775c9a6119a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,62,66,0,87,153,137,69,150,221,123,6,220,94,247,117,201,166,17,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
