His gentle rich warm voice and melodic flowing guitar are appealing on many levels and for all his gentleness he can convey powerful emotions. The material here is all traditional and there are such wonderful songs as Here's The Tender Coming/ Lord Lovel/ The Dalesman's Litany/ William taylor/ The Bleacher Lassie O'Kelvinhaugh and others.\n\nb. 12 July 1941, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. A respected and long-established performer, Burland has a wide repertoire of material ranging from the traditional to the contemporary, including many songs that are not often classified as Ã¢â‚¬ËœfolkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Having turned professional in 1968, after leaving the Police Force, Burland toured throughout Europe, Hong Kong and Australia during his career, as well as keeping a busy schedule on the UK club scene. His first recording, A DalesmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Litany, an album of traditional songs, was voted Melody Maker Folk Album Of The Year in 1971. In marked contrast, his third release Songs And Buttered Haycocks, featured songs by writers such as Richard Thompson, David Ackles and Mike Waterson. In 1976 Burland joined the revived folk rock act Hedgehog Pie, helping record their final release, Just Act Normal. During his time with Hedgehog Pie, Burland also recorded Songs Of Ewan MacColl with Tony Capstick and Dick Gaughan. The solo sets You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fool The Fat Man and RollinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, meanwhile, featured songs drawn from such diverse names as Randy Newman and Cyril Tawney. WillinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a live recording featuring earlier material alongside previously unrecorded works. In 1992, Burland tackled the work of Richard Thompson on His MasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Choice, and also joined Sara Grey and Roger Wilson in the Lost Nation Band. The highly acclaimed Benchmark eschewed the modern slant of his recent work to tackle an eclectic selection of traditional material. BurlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other commitments include hosting folk shows on BBC and independent local radio, as well as organizing folk festivals in Leeds. During the course of his career, he has appeared as session player on albums by folk artists including Mike Harding and Nic Jones. From 1998 Burland was fully employed in a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœday jobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and only performed the occasional gig.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d2584ff0be72355e87bfdaa32e66557232aae2d","amp;dn":"Dave+Burland+-+A+Dalesman%27s+Litany+%5B1971%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d2584ff0be72355e87bfdaa32e66557232aae2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,37,132,255,11,231,35,85,232,123,253,170,50,230,101,87,35,42,174,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
