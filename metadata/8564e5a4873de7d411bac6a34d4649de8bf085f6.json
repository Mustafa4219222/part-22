Since the movie is difficult to find in any form (VHS or DVD) it will be unfortunately difficult to get a better version. It took me around a month to track a copy down and change it into a digital format.\n\nMake sure to read the reviews on IMDB. It is probably better to check and make sure you want to see this movie before you download it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8564e5a4873de7d411bac6a34d4649de8bf085f6","amp;dn":"Lions+Love+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8564e5a4873de7d411bac6a34d4649de8bf085f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,100,229,164,135,61,231,212,17,186,198,163,77,70,73,222,139,240,133,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
