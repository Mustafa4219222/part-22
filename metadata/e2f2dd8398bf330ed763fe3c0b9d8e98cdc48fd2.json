This long, unbroken line of inhuman cruelty connects Nazi Germany to Abu Ghraib, and is an essential issue in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s political landscape.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2f2dd8398bf330ed763fe3c0b9d8e98cdc48fd2","amp;dn":"Torture+-+We+Have+Ways+of+Making+You+Talk+%28Documentary+2005+BBC2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2f2dd8398bf330ed763fe3c0b9d8e98cdc48fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,242,221,131,152,191,51,14,215,99,254,60,11,157,142,152,205,196,143,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
