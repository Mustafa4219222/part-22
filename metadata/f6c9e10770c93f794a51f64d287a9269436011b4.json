Beckwith, Donald Knox\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nA word of caution to people who are considering reading this book. The book tells of how Delta Force was formed...from its beginnings as a US version of the British SAS to its failed first mission freeing the hostages in the Iran. If you're looking for something on what Delta Force currently does and how its operators are currently trained or selected, this isn't the book for you. Beckwith tells us how the first Delta operators were trained and selected, but that selection process has probably changed some by now.\n\n Review\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Delta Force, considered the equivalent of SEAL Team 6, are far more tight-lipped than the SEALs.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Times )\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Delta Force is arguably the most effective fighting unit in the world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Washington Post )\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Absolutely compelling...nations without men like this simply donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t survive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Wall Street Journal )\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most elite commando unit.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Los Angeles Times )\n\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“A page turner. ... Hard to put down. ... One of those rare books that military people will annotate and underline and hesitate ever to lend out. ... BeckwithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candor is extraordinary.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Armed Forces Journal )\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Delta-Force-Militarys-Special-Operations-ebook/dp/B009R53AH4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Delta-Force-Militarys-Special-Operations-ebook/dp/B009R53AH4&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6c9e10770c93f794a51f64d287a9269436011b4","amp;dn":"Delta+Force%3A+A+Memoir+by+the+Founder+of+the+Military%27s+Most+Secr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6c9e10770c93f794a51f64d287a9269436011b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,201,225,7,112,201,63,121,74,81,246,77,40,122,146,105,67,96,17,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
