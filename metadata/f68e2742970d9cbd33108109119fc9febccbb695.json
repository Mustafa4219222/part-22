They quickly developed a more distinctive style of three-part harmonies (heavily influenced by the Everly Brothers), ringing guitars, and hook-happy material, penned by both outside writers (especially Graham Gouldman) and themselves, eventually composing most of their repertoire on their own. The best early Hollies records evoke an infectious, melodic cheer similar to that of the early Beatles, although the Hollies were neither in their class (not an insult: nobody else was) nor demonstrated a similar capacity for artistic growth. They tried, though, easing into somewhat more sophisticated folk-rock and mildly psychedelic sounds as the decade wore on, especially on their albums (which contain quite a few overlooked highlights). ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:w9fpxqw5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:w9fpxqw5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe British have an odd yen for album-length collections of tracks that appeared on EPs in the '60s, even if some or most of them also appeared on LPs and singles. The contents of this 22-song anthology of items from 1964-1966 Hollies EPs are pretty good, but almost everything is available on CD now, in the better context of album or greatest-hits reissues. Frustratingly, it does include two fine Merseyish originals from their debut 1964 EP, &quot;What Kind of Love&quot; and &quot;When I'm Not There,&quot; that never made it onto LP otherwise. Except, that is, for the British 1978 LP compilation The Best of the Hollies' EPs, which duplicates the track listing of this disc almost exactly.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hxfrxq95ldde&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:hxfrxq95ldde&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA review and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000070WZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000070WZ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
