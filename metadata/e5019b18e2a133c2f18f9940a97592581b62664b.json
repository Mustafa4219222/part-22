This book provides the necessary theoretical background and illustration of practice for a radical re-appraisal of how we think about literacy and literacy education.&quot;\nGuy Merchant, Professor of Literacy in Education, Faculty of Development and Society, Sheffield Hallam University\n\nThe new edition of this popular book takes a fresh look at what it means to think of literacies as social practices. The book explores what is distinctively 'new' within a range of currently popular everyday ways of generating, communicating and negotiating meanings. Revised, updated and significantly reconceptualised throughout, the book includes:\nCloser analysis of new literacies in terms of active collaboration\nA timely discussion of using wikis and other collaborative online writing resources\nUpdated and expanded accounts of digital remix and blogging practices\nAn explanation of social learning and collaborative platforms for social learning\nA fresh focus on online social networking\nA new batch of discussion questions and stimulus activities\nThe importance of social learning for becoming proficient in many new literacy practices, and the significance of new media for expanding the reach and potential of social learning are discussed in the final part of the book. New Literacies 3/e concludes by describing empirical cases of social learning approaches mediated by collaborative learning platforms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5019b18e2a133c2f18f9940a97592581b62664b","amp;dn":"New+Literacies%3A+Everyday+Practices+and+Social+Learning%2C+3rd+edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5019b18e2a133c2f18f9940a97592581b62664b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,1,155,24,226,161,51,194,241,143,153,64,169,117,146,88,27,98,102,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
