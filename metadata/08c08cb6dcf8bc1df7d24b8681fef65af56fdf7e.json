The clones are kept isolated from the real world by workers of the colony, but are promised to be &quot;accepted&quot; to move to &quot;America&quot; after they have completed some type of physical training.\r\n\r\nDirector Robert S. Fiveson brought a copyright infringement suit against the makers of The Island (2005). The lawsuit cited 89 points of similarity between &quot;Clonus&quot; and &quot;The Island&quot;, and the court ruled that Fiveson made a prima facie case for infringement. Before the case could go to trial, Dreamworks settled with the plaintiffs for an undisclosed amount. It's been rumored that it was a seven-figure sum.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 674x574, 25.000 fps, 2000 Kbps, 01h26m30s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 224 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ahjuz07f3/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/uvh4g4izb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/yqfx4ycrb/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/g9lie4wt3/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/m999hshlj/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08c08cb6dcf8bc1df7d24b8681fef65af56fdf7e","amp;dn":"The+Clonus+Horror+%281979+-+USA%29+science+fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08c08cb6dcf8bc1df7d24b8681fef65af56fdf7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,192,140,182,220,248,188,29,247,210,75,134,129,254,246,90,245,111,223,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
