Many of these songs, like &quot;I Want You to Want Me&quot; and &quot;Big Eyes,&quot; were pleasant in their original form, but seemed more like sketches compared to the roaring versions on this album. With their ear-shatteringly loud guitars and sweet melodies, Cheap Trick unwittingly paved the way for much of the hard rock of the next decade, as well as a surprising amount of alternative rock of the 1990s, and it was At Budokan that captured the band in all of its power.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\nHello There Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:27\nCome On, Come On Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\nLookout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\nBig Eyes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\nNeed Your Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:46\nAin't That a Shame Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\nI Want You to Want Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:45\nSurrender Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:25\nGoodnight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:08\nClock Strikes Ten Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:01\n\n\nComplete album artwork and and audio logs are included.
