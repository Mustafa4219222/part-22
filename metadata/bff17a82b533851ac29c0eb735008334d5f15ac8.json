Dudley Dickerson&amp;#039;s battle in the kitchen is a highlight.\n\nMen In Black(1934): Medical malpractice is an understatement when describing what the Stooges do to the Los Arms Hospital, where they dispense unorthodox advice, flirt with the nurses and battle a babbling intercom system. With: Dell Henderson, Jeannie Roberts and Billy Gilbert.\n\nMicro-phonies (1945): When Curly is mistaken for an opera diva, the Stooges find their calling on the stage as Senorita Cucaracha (Curly) and Senors Mucho and Gusto (Larry and Moe). With: Christine McIntyre, Symona Boniface and Gino Corrado.\n\nPunch Drunks(1934): Larry&amp;#039;s rendition of Pop Goes The Weasel transforms Curly from a harmless cream puff into a vicious contender, but when Larry&amp;#039;s violin breaks, it threatens Curly&amp;#039;s boxing career with a TKO. With: Dorothy Granger and Al Hill.\n\nThree Little Pigskins (1934): When the Stooges are mistaken for star football players, they not only find themselves running for goals but running for their lives when they get mixed up with the gorgeous girlfriends of a group of mobsters. With: Lucille Ball, Gertie Green and Phyllis Crane.\n\nWoman Haters(1934): When Larry breaks his oath to the Woman Haters Club by marrying, he is treated like a traitor by his fellow members. But getting out of the marriage may be even more harmful than anything his friends could ever do to him. The Stooges&amp;#039; first short was done entirely in rhyme.
