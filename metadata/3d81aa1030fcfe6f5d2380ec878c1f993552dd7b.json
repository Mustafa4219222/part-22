Exhausted and desperate, the young mother finally fled with her three children in 1999 to Delhi, where she found work as a maid in some of the city's wealthiest homes.\n\nExpected to serve her employers' every grueling demand, Halder faced a staggering workload that often left her no time to care for her own children.\n\nThe young woman's luck finally turned when she started working for Prabodh Kumar, a retired anthropology professor who noticed Halder's interest in his library. Kumar helped her to read his books and newspapersÃ¢â‚¬â€which she devoured enthusiasticallyÃ¢â‚¬â€then suggested that she write down her own life story. In A Life Less Ordinary, the fascinating result of her writing sessions with Kumar, Halder speaks for a multitude of Indian women, revealing a world of poverty and subjugation few outsiders have heard about. Halder writes simply and candidly of her life as a young girl, and later as a struggling mother.\n\nWithout a trace of melodrama or self-pity, she describes her experiences of growing up poor and neglected, struggling to manage children and a violent husband while she herself was only fourteen years old, and, finally, of escaping her past ultimately to triumph as a writer.\n\nAlready a huge success in India, where it has been published in Hindi, Bengali, and several other languages, A Life Less Ordinary is an astonishing story of strength, courage, and determination that continues to inspire readers everywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d81aa1030fcfe6f5d2380ec878c1f993552dd7b","amp;dn":"A+Life+Less+Ordinary-+A+Memoir+by+Baby+Halder+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d81aa1030fcfe6f5d2380ec878c1f993552dd7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,129,170,16,48,252,254,111,93,35,128,236,135,140,31,153,53,82,221,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
