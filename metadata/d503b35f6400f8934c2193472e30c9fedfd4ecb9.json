The album distinguishes itself from other recent Dondero releases with exclusive use of acoustic instruments and extensive use of vocal harmony. Clay Leverett (Now It's Overhead) and Ken Will Morton also make guest appearances with backing vocals and harmonica respectively. The 13-track album features original compositions side by side with Dondero's interpretations of songs by artists such as Little Feat, Elizabeth Cotten, Charlie Pride, Neil Young, Woody Guthrie, Doug Sahm, Jawbreaker, Bob Dylan and Jimmie Rodgers.\n\n1.
