Rain-viny\n\nMother, wife, private investigator...vampire. Six years ago federal agent Samantha Moon was the perfect wife and mother, your typical soccer mom with the minivan and suburban home. Then the unthinkable happens, an attack that changes her life forever. And forever is a very long time for a vampire.\n\nNow the world at large thinks Samantha has developed a rare skin disease, a disease which forces her to quit her day job and stay out of the light of the sun. Now working the night shift as a private investigator, Samantha is hired by Kingsley Fulcrum to investigate the murder attempt on his life, a horrific scene captured on TV and seen around the country. But as the case unfolds, Samantha discovers Kingsley isn't exactly what he appears to be; after all, there is a reason why he survived five shots to the head","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a02eaa3eb21d71593403f9ff4c369599fc2307","amp;dn":"Moon+Dance+%28Vampire+for+Hire+%231%29+-+J.R.+Rain-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a02eaa3eb21d71593403f9ff4c369599fc2307","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,160,46,170,62,178,29,113,89,52,3,249,255,76,54,149,153,252,35,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
