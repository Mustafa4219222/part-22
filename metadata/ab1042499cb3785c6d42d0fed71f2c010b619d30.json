Through this desolate strip rides legendary gunslinger Falcon MacCallister, a young Indian boy by his side. Behind him lies a scene of horror left by outlaws who'd ambushed a small wagon train. As he searches the Panhandle for the killers, Falcon enters a storm of greed, thievery, and betrayal that has its roots in two long, gleaming bands of steel. A new railway is penetrating this hostile land--making some people rich, some people dead, and sending a gunfighter and a boy on their own brutal ride to revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1042499cb3785c6d42d0fed71f2c010b619d30","amp;dn":"William+Johnstone+-Eagles+08+Blood+of+Eagles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1042499cb3785c6d42d0fed71f2c010b619d30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,16,66,73,156,179,120,92,109,66,208,254,215,31,44,1,11,97,157,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
