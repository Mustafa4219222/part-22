When they \r\ninnocently try to pay their dinner bill with phony money, Stan and Ollie are \r\nput to work in the kitchen of the Alpen Hotel. Their enforced stay coincides \r\nwith the visit of famed composer Walter Woolf King, who has come to \r\nSwitzerland to soak up &quot;local colour.&quot; He also hopes to write an operetta \r\nthat will succeed on its own merits, without the lovely voice of his lovely \r\nactress wife Della Lynd winning over the audience. But Lynd is determined to \r\nstar in King's latest opus, and to that end she finagles Stan and Ollie into \r\ngetting her a job as a hotel chambermaid. As the plot rolls along its merry \r\nway, Ollie labours under the misapprehension that Lynd is in love with him. \r\nSwiss Miss is, on the whole, one of Laurel and Hardy's weaker feature films, \r\nwith far too much emphasis on the romantic leads and way too many forgettable \r\nsongs (&quot;Crick Crick Crick Here the Cricket&quot; is a particular low point). But \r\nthe team's individual scenes save the show, even though Stan Laurel, who'd \r\nbeen ill during production, looks like he's about to fall asleep at any \r\nmoment. Best bits: Stan hoodwinking a St. Bernard out of a cask of brandy; \r\nOllie serenading Lynd while Stan accompanies him on tube; and the legendary \r\nsequence, immortalized by film critic James Agee, wherein Stan and Ollie try \r\nto transport a piano across a rope bridge high above an alpine chasm--only \r\nto confront a gorilla! One of the screenwriters of Swiss Miss was Jean \r\nNegulesco, later the director of such memorable films as Mask of Dmitrios, \r\nThree Strangers, Titanic and How to Marry a Millionaire.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Stan Laurel.\r\n=&gt;-Oliver Hardy.\r\n=&gt;-Grete Natzler.\r\n\r\nDirectors.\r\n=&gt;-Hal Roach.\r\n=&gt;-John G Blystone.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre.........................: Classic : Adventure : Comedy : Family.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date..................: 1938.\r\n=&gt;-Language......................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size.....................: 1.02 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate..............: 2 006 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime.................: 1h 11min.\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec.........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio..................: 4:3.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution....................: 720 x 544.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate......................: 1 890 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio 1 English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec.........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels......................: 1 channel.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate......................: 112 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate..............: 150 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8133425886b0219c4eb457e0d76a15771c3b20","amp;dn":"Laurel+And+Hardy+Swiss+Miss+-+Comedy+Eng+Subs+1938+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8133425886b0219c4eb457e0d76a15771c3b20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,129,51,66,88,134,176,33,156,78,180,87,224,215,106,21,119,28,59,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
