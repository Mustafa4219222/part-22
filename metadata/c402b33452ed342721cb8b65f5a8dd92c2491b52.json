He and Ratchet arrive at a centuries-old crashed Autobot ship \nand venture inside. Though they expect there may be survivors, they find the crew has succumbed to Cybonic Plague. \nAs the ship shifts, a deceased Autobot hanging from the ceiling drips plague-imbued Energon onto Optimus. \nLater at base, Optimus lays stricken while the others discuss the situation. The Cybonic Plague was developed by \nMegatron and Ratchet thinks they might be able to find information in the Decepticon databases. \nArcee and Bumblebee Groundbridge onto the Nemesis and, narrowly hiding from Knock Out, enter the ship's lab. \nInside, Arcee scours the database, but fails to find a cure for the Cybonic Plague. \nWhile she's doing so, Bumblebee stumbles on Megatron's comatose form. Arcee is ready to finish Megatron off then and there, \nbut Ratchet has a better idea ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ enter Megatron's mind and retrieve the plague cure. \nRatchet knows of a procedure to create a cortical psychic patch. Though such procedures have been banned by the Autobots for years, \nit will get them into Megatron's mind, and Bumblebee is willing to try it. On the ship's bridge, \nStarscream complains that the ship's electromagnetic shielding has not been fixed, and directs the Vehicons to hurry up \nand do so before the Autobots detect them. Afterwards Starscream has a private word with Knock Out, \nsuggesting that the Decepticons deserve a leader who is conscious, and the pair come to an understanding whereby Knock Out \nwill be Starscream's new second-in-command. Meanwhile, Arcee plugs Bumblebee into Megatron, and Bumblebee finds himself in a simulation of Kaon. \nRatchet creates a communications downlink, so they can monitor what Bumblebee is doing. Bumblebee wanders though Kaon until \nhe finds what appears to be Optimus, but is just a figment of Megaton's imagination. Megatron appears and slays the false Optimus, \nwho dissolves into smoke. Another Optimus appears, and as Megatron fires his fusion cannon, Bumblebee jumps in the path of the blast, \nonly to find it passes right through him to slay the imaginary Optimus. Megatron, however, has seen Bumblebee and attempts to strike him, \nbut his blows pass clean through Bumblebee. While Megatron is trying to work out what's going on, Optimus, Bulkhead and another Bumblebee appear, \nall figments of his imagination. Megatron destroys them, but begins to realize that he's in his own subconscious. \nArcee becomes anxious when Starscream, Knock Out and Soundwave enter the lab, though the 2 Autobots are hidden well enough that \nthe Decepticons don't see them. Starscream is determined to put on a show for Soundwave, to convince his fellow Decepticon that \nMegatron is beyond saving. He and Knock Out attempt to persuade Soundwave that putting Megatron out of his misery is the best thing. \nArcee and Ratchet overhear their conversation, and Ratchet says terminating Megatron will permanently separate Bumblebee's mind and body. \nIn the dream world, Megatron ponders what has happened to him, and finds out from Bumblebee about the space bridge explosion. Short on time, \nBumblebee relays the news about Optimus's Cybonic Plague infection. Megatron is amused that after all this time Optimus will be felled by a virus, \nbut Bumblebee plays on his desire to finish Optimus himself. Starscream is about to pull the plug on Megatron when Soundwave points out \nthe psychic patch cable. Starscream begins following it, as Arcee observes from her hiding place. Megatron briefly shows Bumblebee the formula \nfor the virus cure, but will only share it if Bumblebee can release him from his mental prison. Unknown to Megatron, \nRatchet can still see everything Bumblebee sees. Having ganked the formula, Ratchet tells Arcee to cut the link. \nMegatron's dream world begins to disintegrate and the Decepticon leader launches himself at the disappearing Bumblebee. \nBumblebee then comes around as Starscream finds the 2 hidden Autobots, and, as they escape through the Groundbridge, \nArcee blasts one of the cables attached to Megatron. Starscream is actually pleased that Megatron has flatlined as a result, \nbut at Soundwave's insistence has Knock Out reconnect the cable. As Optimus is cured, the Autobots celebrate, \nbut Optimus insists the celebration should be for Ratchet and Bumblebee. On the Nemesis, Knock Out observes that Megatron is no longer \nexhibiting any brainwave activity ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ there's no one home. Unknown to anyone, Megatron resides in Bumblebee's head.\n \n[B] Note:[/B] This episode ends as a cliffhanger, revealing that what happens next will be concluded in the next episode, &quot;Out of His Head.&quot; \n\n[B]Spoken language:[/B] English\n====================================================================================\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nCast\n===========\n\nSeries cast summary: \n----------------------\n\nKevin Michael Richardson  ...
