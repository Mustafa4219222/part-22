Luckily I finally found someone else who had ripped it. I do not know the source of the rip but the songs were ripped at 320 kbs. The quality is quite good considering that this album was not released on cd.\n\nThis album was The Call's first taste of commercial success. It featured the political single 'The Walls Came Down' that became an early MTV favorite. The song used Biblical imagery from the book of Joshua, hinting at the direction Been's lyrics would take over the next several years.\n\nGarth Hudson, keyboardist for The Band provided backup on several songs of this album, which cemented the critical assessment that The Call was the successor to The Band.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f13360e8751134cdad61a3428ef2570a56e7d7e","amp;dn":"The+Call+-+Modern+Romans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f13360e8751134cdad61a3428ef2570a56e7d7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,19,54,14,135,81,19,76,218,214,26,52,40,239,37,112,165,110,125,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
