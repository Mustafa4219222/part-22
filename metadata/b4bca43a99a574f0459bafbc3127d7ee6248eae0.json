About 40 \n\nPercent of these books are either out of publication as Hard Copies or exist as \n\ndead torrents in the torrent graveyard of the internet.\n\n\nWHY UPLOAD eBOOKS ON EARLIER VERSIONS OF PHOTOSHOP ?\n\n1. Because some of these eBooks give a rare insight into the techniques of \n\nPhotoshop which eBooks of later versions may not, ( although eBooks of latest \n\nversions are also included).\n\n\n2.
