The song was written by Joe Jonas and James Fauntleroy and produced by Rob Knox, taken from his debut solo album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFastlifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The official music video for the song premiered on September 12, 2011 on E! News. It was directed by Jaci Judelson. The video is composed of shots of Joe Jonas and his female companion (played by French model Angele) as they make out all around one of EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most beautiful cities, weaving together the tale of their brief but passionate love affair. However, all good things must come to an end and Joe leaves his French lady love behind. The video closes out with Joe looking back as he walks away in the dark of the night.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab1f9c105ecd8d605f39d611899436dee8bf3147","amp;dn":"Joe+Jonas+%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Just+In+Love+%5BiTunes+Plus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab1f9c105ecd8d605f39d611899436dee8bf3147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,31,156,16,94,205,141,96,95,57,214,17,137,148,54,222,232,191,49,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
