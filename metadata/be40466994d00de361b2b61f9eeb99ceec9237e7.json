With his porcelain skin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now, he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret.\n\nWhat Bella doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t realize is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And, it might be too late to turn back ...\n\n\nPersonally, this was probably one of my favorite novel series to read in a long time. I honestly think I was more excited to read the sequels in this series than I was for the Harry Potter books. But since the series is, in fact, a Teen Vampire Romance ... the film (and novels) have been described as cheesy, but if you realize youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to be watching an adaptation of a Teen Vampire Romance novel, I think you may find the film a bit simple, but the story is emotionally complex, as well as a satisfying fantasy, and thanks to the work of two fairly good young actors, the connection they portray is believable.\n\nAs many of you know, I haven't been uploading torrents as much lately, and the reason is because I can upload more iPod content faster tothan via torrent, but since most of my loyal downloaders are still torrenting, I'll continue to upload at least one torrent a week.  This was requested a few weeks ago, and I'm actually GLAD I waited because recently HolyRoses, a fellow Portable's uploader, has discovered how to encode a larger resolution video that is still iPod compatible ... even with the Older iPods!!!\n\nNow, I've personally tested this on an iPod 5G, an iPod Nano 3G, an iPod Classic 6G, and an iPod Touch 1G ... so I know it works on ALL iPods because of the overlap of compatibilites.  So don't worry whether it will work on your iPod ... IT WILL!  And you don't have to worry about it being &quot;squished&quot; or look wierd.  The Aspect Ratio is intact and it looks great on every iPod I've tried syncing it to!  Now, Quicktime/iTunes show this as a 854x358 video which displays at 855x358, but the actual resolution is 853x358 ... it depends on the media player you use, but you can take a look at these screens and see that it looks absolutely gorgeous.  I used the 720p HD BluRay rip from SEPTiC as the source for this encode and even with the higher bitrate and resolution, the file-size is quite reasonable!  Enjoy! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight01.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight01.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight02.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight02.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight03.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight03.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight04.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight04.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight05.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight05.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight06.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight06.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight07.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight07.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight08.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight08.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight09.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight09.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight10.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high!  Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling.  Be kind, rewind!  Remember to eat your green vegetables.
