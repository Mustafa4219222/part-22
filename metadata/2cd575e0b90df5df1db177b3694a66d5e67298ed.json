In this two-hour special, CNBC investigates the origins of the global economic collapse. The personal stories of key participants: home buyers, mortgage brokers, investment bankers and investors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all of whom let greed blind them to marketplace realities.\n\nIt is their words and experiences ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not those of pundits or commentators ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that bring to life the painful story of the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression. How a financial house of cards was slowly built following the 9/11 attacks. As the U.S. government tried to revive the economy by repeatedly dropping interest rates, families lunged at the opportunity to refinance their mortgages. Faber introduces viewers to mortgage lenders who drastically reduced borrowers' credit requirements and raked in personal profits of $5 million a month.\n\nWall Street began to consume risky mortgages and turn them into products they could sell to hungry foreign investors, no matter how risky the package, during the peak of the lending frenzy any mortgage-backed security could find a home on Wall Street. Exploring just how far the effect of the credit crisis extended.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 700 MiB for 1h 30mn 17s 952ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 947 Kbps\nAspect            : 432 x 320 (1.350) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd575e0b90df5df1db177b3694a66d5e67298ed","amp;dn":"House+of+Cards+CNBC+%5BPDTV%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd575e0b90df5df1db177b3694a66d5e67298ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,213,117,224,185,13,245,223,29,177,119,179,105,74,102,213,230,114,152,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
