After the milestone events of Grimm Fairy Tales #50 creatures from the realm of Myst have escaped into our world. Captured by the evil Baba Yaga for her sinister plans they are about to cause major havoc on earth. Written by Raven Gregory (ZenescopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wonderland trilogy) this first arc revisits the characters and story from the very first issue of Grimm Fairy Tales Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Little Red Riding Hood. Brittany, our hero from issue #1 is back, working in a treatment center for adolescents. Little does she know that something from another realm has caught her scent and will stop at nothing to find and destroy her before her true purpose is revealed.\n\nThe series continues with the same format. Characters from the original series are introduced here in story arcs. Additionally the main heroine of this series is Samantha Darren who works against the manipulations of the dark forces aligned against her. In some story arcs she is featured working towards that goal (such as in the Gathering and the Summoning.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7f180e798658121775c16d74f0468c4b064bbaf","amp;dn":"Grimm+Fairy+Tales+-+Myths+%26amp%3B+Legends+%28001+-+025%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7f180e798658121775c16d74f0468c4b064bbaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,241,128,231,152,101,129,33,119,92,22,215,79,4,104,196,176,100,187,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
