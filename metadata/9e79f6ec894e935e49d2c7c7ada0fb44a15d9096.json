We're an independant electronic band. Share as much as you want! Our music will always be free.\r\n\r\nSince the last torrent, we've focussed on a mainly electronic/synthpop sound. I guess we are influenced by Regurgitator, The Chemical Brothers, VNV Nation, Planet Funk, Pendulum, Infected Mushroom, The Bloody Beetroots, Nine Inch Nails, The Dandy Warhols and The Prodigy. There's probably something you'll like in here.\r\n\r\n01-Escapism-Eagle\r\n02-Escapism-Thomas The Crunk Engine and The Phat Controller (Instru-mental)\r\n03-Escapism-Ship to Shore\r\n04-Escapism-The Phonic Halt\r\n05-Escapism-Alright\r\n06-Escapism-Cascading Style\r\n07-Escapism-A Lost Idea Within The Endless Horizons Of Divinity\r\n08-Escapism-Bowling Day\r\n09-Escapism-Trust\r\n10-Escapism-The Carrot Farmer Riot\r\n\r\nYou can find more junk like this at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e79f6ec894e935e49d2c7c7ada0fb44a15d9096","amp;dn":"Escapism+-+You+Should+Trust+Us+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e79f6ec894e935e49d2c7c7ada0fb44a15d9096","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,121,246,236,137,78,147,94,73,210,199,199,173,160,251,68,161,93,144,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
