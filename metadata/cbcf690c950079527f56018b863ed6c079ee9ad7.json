The nineteen papers reflect the research interests of the Commission which span the period from the Enlightenment to the evolution of Geographical Information Science. Apart from studies on general cartography, the volume, which reflects some co-operation with the ICA Commission on Maps and Society and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), contains regional studies on cartographic endeavours in Northern America, Brazil, and Southern Africa.\nThe ICA Commission on Maps and Society participated as its field of study often overlaps with that of the ICA Commission on the History of Cartography. The USGS which is the official USA mapping organisation, was invited to emphasise that the ICA Commission on the History of Cartography is not only interested in historical maps, but also has as mandate the research and document the history of Geographical Information Science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbcf690c950079527f56018b863ed6c079ee9ad7","amp;dn":"History+of+Cartography+-+International+Symposium+of+the+ICA+Comm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbcf690c950079527f56018b863ed6c079ee9ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,207,105,12,149,0,121,82,127,86,1,139,134,62,214,192,121,238,154,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
