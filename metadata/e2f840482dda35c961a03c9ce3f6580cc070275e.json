It was released both as a single album and as a double album (known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition). The album is supported by a video, AC/DC: Live at Donington.[1]\n\nAC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc &quot;book&quot; (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note.\n\nThe album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.\n\nThe recordings on this disc are taken from several shows from AC/DC's 1991 The Razors Edge tour. Most of the recordings are from the Donington &amp; Moscow &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; shows, and some from other various shows from the tour.\n\nTrack listings\n\n1 CD edition\n\nAll songs written and composed by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Brian Johnson, except where noted. \n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength\n\n1. \t&quot;Thunderstruck&quot;   \tYoung, Young \t6:34\n2. \t&quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot;   \t  \t5:21\n3. \t&quot;Back in Black&quot;   \t  \t4:28\n4. \t&quot;Who Made Who&quot;   \t  \t5:15\n5. \t&quot;Heatseeker&quot;   \t  \t3:37\n6. \t&quot;The Jack&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Bon Scott \t6:56\n7. \t&quot;Moneytalks&quot; (Not on vinyl) \tYoung, Young \t4:18\n8. \t&quot;Hells Bells&quot;   \t  \t6:01\n9. \t&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t5:02\n10. \t&quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t4:30\n11. \t&quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;   \t  \t3:54\n12. \t&quot;Highway to Hell&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t3:58\n13. \t&quot;T.N.T.&quot;   \tYoung, Young, Scott \t3:47\n14. \t&quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot;   \t  \t7:09\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nExtension File Format: mp3\n\nBitrate: 128 kbps\n\nThe album is supported by a video, AC/DC: Live at Donington: NOT INCLUDED (sorry)\n\n\nREAPER\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2f840482dda35c961a03c9ce3f6580cc070275e","amp;dn":"AC%2FDC.AC%2FDC+Live.1+CD.Edition.1992.Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2f840482dda35c961a03c9ce3f6580cc070275e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,248,64,72,45,218,53,201,97,160,60,156,227,246,88,12,192,112,39,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
