So I felt, before I do the Mai lists, I do a special to mark the Jubilee. It has become an odd mix of old and new songs and is already one of my favourites (I like nice and easy). All interesting tracks in the best quality you are used to get from me.\n\nIf you like other music as well, please download Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear Mr. PresidentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and seed to make a point. Strangely it might make a difference.\n\nEnjoy and seed.\n\n\nDutch Treat - Indie Playlists @1 The Flag\n\n01 - Land Locked Blues (Bright Eyes)\n02 - Divided (Tegan &amp; Sara)\n03 - Bats In The Belfry (A) (Dispatch)\n04 - God &amp; Satan (Biffy Clyro)\n05 - Easy (A) (Emiliana Torrini)\n06 - The Way That Leaving Goes (Julean &amp; The Rai)\n07 - Always (Panic!
