It is revered within Gaudiya Vaishnavism, whose founder, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1534), re-discovered a part of the work, the 62 verses of Chapter 5, at the Adikeshav Temple in Thiruvattur, Kerala, Southern India in the 16th Century which had previously been lost for a few centuries.The text contains a highly esoteric description, with the Kama-Gayatri, of Krishna in His abode Goloka.\n\nThe text was first translated from Sanskrit into English by Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati Thakur in 1932 and is often sung or recited as a both devotional and philosophical text.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Hymns of BrahmaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were recited or sung countless millennia ago by the first created being in the universe, just prior to the act of creation. The text surfaced and entered calculable history early in the sixteenth century, when it was discovered by a pilgrim exploring the manuscript library of an ancient temple in what is now Kerala State in south India. Prior to the introduction of the printing press, texts like Brahma-samhita existed only in manuscript form, painstakingly handwritten by scribes and kept under brahminical custodianship in temples, where often they were worshiped as shastra - Deity, or God incarnate in holy scripture.\n\nSri Chaitanya found Ã¢â‚¬Å“one chapter of the Brahma-samhita.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (What we now have as Brahma-samhita is, according to tradition, only one of a hundred chapters composing an epic work lost to humanity.) Upon discovering the manuscript, Sri Chaitanya felt great ecstasy and fell into an intense mystic rapture that overflowed onto the physical realm, producing a profusion of tears, trembling, and perspiration.\n\nThe Brahma-samhita's account of Lord Brahma's enlightenment is quite interesting and can be summarized here. When Lord Garbhodakashayi Vishnu desires to recreate the universe, a divine golden lotus flower grows from his navel, and Brahma is born from the lotus. As he is not born from parents, Brahma is known as Svayambhu, Ã¢â‚¬Å“self-existentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“unoriginated.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Upon his emergence from the lotus, Lord Brahma beginsÃ¢â‚¬â€in preparation for his role as secondary creatorÃ¢â‚¬â€to contemplate the act of cosmic creation but, seeing only darkness about, is bewildered in the performance of his duty. Sarasvati, the goddess of learning, appears before him and instructs him to meditate upon the kama-bija mantra, promising that this mantra Ã¢â‚¬Å“will assuredly fulfill your hearts desire.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d7fd92acf1f58860666327c78f75a562fcf3227","amp;dn":"Sri+Brahma+samhita+1932","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d7fd92acf1f58860666327c78f75a562fcf3227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,127,217,42,207,31,88,134,6,102,50,124,120,247,90,86,47,207,50,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
