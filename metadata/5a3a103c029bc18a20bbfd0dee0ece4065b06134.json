John Markoffâ€™s landmark book is about the culture and consciousness behind the first PCsâ€”the culture being counterâ€“ and the consciousness expanded, sometimes chemically. Itâ€™s a brilliant evocation of Stanford, California, in the 1960s and â€™70s, where a group of visionaries set out to turn computers into a means for freeing minds and information. In these pages one encounters Ken Kesey and the phone hacker Capâ€™n Crunch, est and LSD, The Whole Earth Catalog and the Homebrew Computer Lab. What the Dormouse Said is a poignant, funny, and inspiring book by one of the smartest technology writers around.\r\n\r\nazw3 can be converted in Calibre to whichever format you prefer, or can be directly placed in a Kindle file directory. Having been told I was uploading &quot;useless&quot; azw3 files, I hope you take the time to read this, learn about Calibre, or shut the fuck up. Cheers. Enjoy. \r\n\r\n                heliiaruy       heliiaruy       heliiaruy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a3a103c029bc18a20bbfd0dee0ece4065b06134","amp;dn":"What+the+Dormouse+Said+++%5E++++John+Markoff+++++%5E++++++++azw3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a3a103c029bc18a20bbfd0dee0ece4065b06134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,58,16,60,2,155,193,138,32,187,253,13,238,14,206,64,101,176,97,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
