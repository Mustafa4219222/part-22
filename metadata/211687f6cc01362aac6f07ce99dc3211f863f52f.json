It was recorded during the band's World Slavery Tour.\n\nThe first 13 tracks (12 songs and the intro) were recorded at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California on March 14-17 1985. The last 5 songs were recorded earlier on the same tour, at the Hammersmith Odeon (now known as the Hammersmith Apollo) in London on October 8, 9, 10 and 12 1984. On the original double LP version, the songs from Long Beach are on the first three sides, whereas the songs recorded in London (&quot;Wrathchild&quot;, &quot;Children of the Damned&quot;, &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot;, &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;) were on side four.\n\nThe initial CD version (released in December, 1985) of this album includes everything that the first three sides of the LP version contain. The fourth side was not included on the original release, due to capacity problems. Also, &quot;Running Free&quot; is shortened from about 8:43 on vinyl to about 3:16 on the CD by eliminating the crowd interaction. There are also only 12 tracks, as the intro to track 1, &quot;Aces High&quot; is actually just included with the track itself. The 1998 remastered re-release has the unedited version, and includes a second CD with the tracks that were previously missing. It should be noted that the 1995 re-release also has an extra CD, but that had the b-sides from the singles on it. Also, this re-release was not remastered.\n\nThe Live After Death video was also recorded at the Long Beach Arena, but on a different night. It contains almost the entire gig, complete with intro and encore, and closes with &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, which was not on the LP or original CD release of the album. A live Version of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; Recorded at the Long Beach Shows was included on a Bonus Disk Packaged with the 1995 reissue, this Disk also Includes &quot;Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)&quot; and &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; from the Hammersmith Shows.\n\nThe cover art was done by Derek Riggs, and pictures the band's mascot, Eddie rising from a grave. On that grave is a tombstone with a quote from the fantasy and horror fiction author H. P. Lovecraft's The Nameless City:\n\n    &quot;That is not dead which can eternal lie\n    Yet with strange aeons even death may die.&quot;\n\nThe proper quote is actually &quot;And with strange...&quot; instead of &quot;Yet with strange...&quot;. See also: the Necronomicon. Also engraved onto the headstone is what appears to be Eddie's full name, &quot;Edward T H--&quot;, the remainder of his supposed surname obscured by a clump of sod.\n\nThe cover depicts Eddie as he is seen on covers before Piece of Mind (with long hair) though he is also bound by metal cuffs connected by an electrical surge, as seen in Powerslave merchandise, and also the metal headgear from his Piece of Mind lobotomy.\n\nThe back cover also shows Death in the clouds above the destroyed city. This is the fourth cover where its figure can be seen (the first being &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, the second being &quot;The Trooper&quot; and the third being the back of Powerslave. The fifth time is the back of Somewhere in Time. Though the reaper is also portrayed by Eddie himself on Dance of Death and Death on the Road). Near Eddie's grave there's also a black cat with a circle made of light over its head. A the cat's left, there is a tombstone written &quot;Here lies Derek Riggs&quot;.\n\nIn 2007 The National Entertainment Collectibles Association released an action figure diorama of the album cover. It is the third in the series. Other available figures are based on Somewhere in Time, Phantom of the Opera and Piece of Mind\n\nIntro\n\nThe intro before &quot;Aces High&quot; is a part of the We shall fight on the beaches speech made by Winston Churchill in the House of Commons on June 4, 1940. (Churchill re-recorded the speech - the original speech in the House of Commons was not recorded.):\n\n    &quot;... We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender ...&quot;\n\n[edit] Critical reception\n\nLive After Death was well received by the music press. Allmusic's Greg Prato described it as &quot;one of heavy metal's best live albums&quot;. Metal Observer contributor Luca Moscatiello, described it as &quot;one of the very few live-albums that plays an essential role into the discography of a band, and into the history of a musical style as well&quot;.[1] PopMatters critic Adrien Begrand mentioned that Live After Death was one of &quot;the greatest live album in heavy metal history&quot;.[2] Alastair Ridell of Kerrang! said it's &quot;possibly the greatest live album of all time&quot;[3]\n\nCD 1\n\n   1. &quot;Intro: Churchill's Speech&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:49 (Winston Churchill)\n   2. &quot;Aces High&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n   3. &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03 (Bruce Dickinson, Adrian Smith)\n   4. &quot;The Trooper&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n   5. &quot;Revelations&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11 (Dickinson)\n   6. &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27 (Dickinson, Smith)\n   7. &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 13:18\n   8. &quot;Powerslave&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:13 (Dickinson)\n   9. &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n  10. &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:21\n  11. &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n  12. &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n  13. &quot;Running Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:43 (Paul Di'Anno, Harris)\n\nCD 2 (1998 release)\n\n   1. &quot;Wrathchild&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n   2. &quot;22 Acacia Avenue&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:19 (Smith, Harris)\n   3. &quot;Children of the Damned&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:37\n   4. &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13 (Dickinson, Smith, Harris)\n   5. &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:211687f6cc01362aac6f07ce99dc3211f863f52f","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+Live+After+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"211687f6cc01362aac6f07ce99dc3211f863f52f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,22,135,246,204,1,54,42,172,111,7,206,153,220,50,17,248,99,245,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
