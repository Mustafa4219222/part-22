The Federal triumph at Vicksburg has secured complete control of the Mississippi River from the Confederacy, cementing the reputation of Ulysses S. Grant. Farther east, the Federal army under the command of William Rosecrans captures the crucial rail hub at Chattanooga. But Rosecrans is careless, and while pursuing the Confederates, the Federal forces are routed in north Georgia at Chickamauga Creek. Retreating in a panic back to Chattanooga, Rosecrans is pursued by the Confederate forces under General Braxton Bragg. Penned up, with their supply lines severed, the Federal army seems doomed to the same kind of defeat that plagued the Confederates at Vicksburg. But a disgusted Abraham Lincoln has seen enough of General Rosecrans. Ulysses Grant is elevated to command of the entire theater of the war, and immediately replaces Rosecrans with General George Thomas. Grant gathers an enormous force, including armies commanded by Joseph Hooker and GrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friend, William T. Sherman. GrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission is clear: Break the Confederate siege and destroy BraggÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army.  Meanwhile, Bragg wages war as much with his own subordinates as he does with the Federals, creating dissension and disharmony in the Southern ranks, erasing the Confederate armyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s superiority at exactly the wrong time.\n\nBlending evocative historical detail with searing depictions of battle, Jeff Shaara immerses readers in the world of commanders and common soldiers, civilians and statesmen. From the Union side come the voices of Generals Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and George ThomasÃ¢â‚¬â€the vaunted Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock of ChickamaugaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€as well as the young private Fritz Ã¢â‚¬Å“DutchieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bauer. From the Rebel ranks come Generals Bragg, Patrick Cleburne, and James Longstreet, as well as the legendary cavalry commander, Nathan Bedford Forrest. A tale of history played out on a human scale in the grand Shaara tradition, The Smoke at Dawn vividly recreates the climactic months of the war in the West, when the fate of a divided nation truly hangs in the balance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e751d3a11553dd7170aa1437eaad7a8b5272e7b2","amp;dn":"The+Smoke+at+Dawn+by+Jeff+Shaara+%28Retail+-+Request%29+%7BRose88%7D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e751d3a11553dd7170aa1437eaad7a8b5272e7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,81,211,161,21,83,221,113,112,170,20,55,234,173,122,139,82,114,231,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
