It was also released as a single in the same year with &quot;Hey You&quot; as the b-side. It is one of only three songs on the album for which writing credits are shared between Roger Waters and David Gilmour ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the melody and most of the music on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was written by Gilmour while Waters contributed the lyrics and some additional notes.\n\n&quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; is one of the most famous Pink Floyd songs and is known especially for its guitar solos. In 2004, the song was ranked number 314 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2005, it was the last song ever to be performed by Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason together.\n\nWhile most songs on The Wall were written by Waters alone, most of the music for &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; was written by David Gilmour, who originally recorded the instrumental demo during the latter stages of recording his first solo album, hoping to find some later use for it. Gilmour later brought his demo of it to The Wall sessions.\n\nThe song is one of two tracks on The Wall which are free-standing and do not fade into or out of an adjacent track. (The other free-standing song is &quot;Mother&quot;). This is because on the original LP there was a hiatus of the music as side three of the album finished.\n\nAccording to Rolling Stone, the lyrics came from Roger Waters' experience when he was injected with tranquilizers for stomach cramps by a doctor prior to playing a Pink Floyd show in Philadelphia on the band's 1977 In The Flesh tour. &quot;That was the longest two hours of my life&quot;, Waters said. &quot;Trying to do a show when you can hardly lift your arm&quot;. The experience gave him the idea which eventually became the lyrics to this song.\n\nWaters and Gilmour disagreed about how to record the song as Gilmour preferred a more grungy style for the verses. In the end, Waters' preferred opening to the song and Gilmour's final solo were used on the album. Gilmour would later say, &quot;We argued over &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; like mad. Really had a big fight, went on for ages&quot;.\n\nThis song features two guitar solos by David Gilmour. In 1989 the readers of the Pink Floyd fanzine The Amazing Pudding voted this song the best Floyd song of all time. David Gilmour's solo was rated the 4th best guitar solo of all-time, by Guitar World magazine, in a reader poll. Also on Guitar World there are details on David Gilmour's &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; solo stating that the solo (most likely the outro solo) was pieced together from several other solos that Gilmour had been experimenting with at the time. In August 2006, it was voted the greatest guitar solo of all time in a poll by listeners of digital radio station Planet Rock. In addition, David's tone in the song was named best guitar sound by Guitarist magazine in November 2010.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f33c3f8ca15257d57a5dfa463868c3d2b21e4af7","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Comfortably+Numb+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f33c3f8ca15257d57a5dfa463868c3d2b21e4af7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,60,63,140,161,82,87,213,122,93,250,70,56,104,195,210,178,30,74,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
