Through a series of courtroom scenes and flashbacks the lead-up to the crime unfolds, involving Fowle taking in a lodger (David Lodge), who takes a more-than-passing interest in Mrs. Fowle (Beryl Reid). Morgenhall, given an opportunity to shine for the first time in his life, insists on pleading his client &quot;not guilty.&quot;\nBut the case does not go as planned: Morgenhall botches the pleadings and Fowle is found guilty. As Morgenhall drowns his sorrows in a pub, he learns that the Home Office has overruled the verdict: Fowle has been declared not guilty on the grounds that his defence was inadequate.\n\nThe film was released in the USA under the title &quot;Trial and Error.&quot;\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 1.07 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 15mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 023 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nCodec ID                         : H264\nWidth                            : 656 pixels\nHeight                           : 432 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 3:2\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.253\n \n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec434f674341fc1e98f3aa1933d1987fce2ae31a","amp;dn":"Trial+%26amp%3B+Error+%28aka+The+Dock+Brief%29+%281962%29+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec434f674341fc1e98f3aa1933d1987fce2ae31a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,67,79,103,67,65,252,30,152,243,170,25,51,209,152,127,206,42,227,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
