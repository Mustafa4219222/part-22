Though many years have elapsed since its 1979 release, the double-record set remains the best, most concise compilation of the ground-breaking southern rock band. Over the course of two albums, all of Skynyrd\\'s hits -- \\&quot;Sweet Home Alabama,\\&quot; \\&quot;Free Bird,\\&quot; \\&quot;Saturday Night Special,\\&quot; \\&quot;What\\'s Your Name,\\&quot; \\&quot;You Got That Right\\&quot; -- are featured,  as well as essential album tracks like \\&quot;That Smell,\\&quot; \\&quot;Down South Jukin\\',\\&quot; \\&quot;Gimme Three Steps,\\&quot; \\&quot;I Know A Little,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Tuesday\\'s Gone.\\&quot; Some great songs like \\&quot;Working for MCA\\&quot; are missing, and the four-disc box set may be more comprehensive, but it\\'s hard to imagine a better, more concise greatest hits collection than Gold and  Platinum. -- Stephen Thomas Erlewine \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n CD1 \n \n 01.Down south jukin\\' [02:14] \n 02.Saturday night special [05:07] \n 03.Gimme three steps [05:19] \n 04.What\\'s your name [03:34] \n 05.You got that right [03:48] \n 06.Gimme back my bullets [03:31] \n 07.Sweet home alabama [04:44] \n 08.Free bird [14:09] \n \n CD2 \n \n 01.That smell [05:50] \n 02.On the hunt [05:28] \n 03.I ain\\'t the one [03:45] \n 04.Whiskey rock-A-roller [04:19] \n 05.Simple man [05:56] \n 06.I know A little [03:29] \n 07.Tuesday\\'s gone [07:32] \n 08.Comin\\' home [05:31] \n ____ \n \n 84:16 min \n 126,1 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:259cdf0cc3e266bc6a59a55ab25428205393b2c9","amp;dn":"Lynyrd_Skynyrd-Gold_And_Platinum-2CD-%28Retail%29-1979-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"259cdf0cc3e266bc6a59a55ab25428205393b2c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,156,223,12,195,226,102,188,106,89,165,90,178,84,40,32,83,147,178,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
