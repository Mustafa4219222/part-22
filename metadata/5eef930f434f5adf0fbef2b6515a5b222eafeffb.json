Kung Fury decides to travel back in time, to Nazi Germany, in order to kill Hitler and end the Nazi empire once and for all.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nKUNG FURY is an over-the-top action comedy written and directed by David Sandberg. The movie features: arcade-robots, dinosaurs, nazis, vikings, norse gods, mutants and a super kung fu-cop called Kung Fury, all wrapped up in an 80s style action packed adventure.\n\nKung Fury takes place in a variety of exotic locations; 1980s Miami, Asgard and Germany in the 1940s, to name a few. With a limited budget to work with, most of the scenes are shot against a greenscreen backdrop.\n\nKung Fury was funded mainly through a Kickstarter campaign, where people from all around the world showed their support for this project.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRAS\n\nOfficial Trailer (720p)\nBehind the Scenes parts 1 and 2\n&quot;True Survivor&quot; - David Hasselhoff - Official Music Video\nInterview with David Hasselhoff\nWho plays Hitler?\nHello from Cannes\nHackerman's Hacking Tutorials - How to Hack Time","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eef930f434f5adf0fbef2b6515a5b222eafeffb","amp;dn":"Kung+Fury+-+The+Ultimate+Collection+%282015%29+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eef930f434f5adf0fbef2b6515a5b222eafeffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,239,147,15,67,79,90,223,15,190,242,182,81,90,91,34,46,175,239,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
