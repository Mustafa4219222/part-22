However, the Internet of Things is more than a business tool for managing business processes more efficiently and more effectively ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it will also enable a more convenient way of life. Since the term &quot;Internet of Things&quot; first came to attention when the Auto-ID Center launched their initial vision for the EPC network for automatically identifying and tracing the flow of goods within supply-chains, increasing numbers of researchers and practitioners have further developed this vision. The authors in this book provide a research perspective on current and future developments in the Internet of Things. The different chapters cover a broad range of topics from system design aspects and core architectural approaches to end-user participation, business perspectives and applications.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 382 pages\n    * Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (April 12, 2011)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 3642191568\n    * ISBN-13: 978-3642191565","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:881d73f4872c50142bee567b57c1e44059847519","amp;dn":"Architecting+the+Internet+of+Things%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"881d73f4872c50142bee567b57c1e44059847519","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,29,115,244,135,44,80,20,43,238,86,123,87,193,228,64,89,132,117,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
