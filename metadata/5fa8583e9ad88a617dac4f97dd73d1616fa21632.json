The exhibition features seven rare works lent by distinguished European and U.S. museums, as well as two nearly identical images of St. Francis Receiving the Stigmata (c. 1428-1430). Van Eyck's paintings have been renowned through the centuries for their astonishing realism and a mastery of oil painting so consummate that the painter was long credited with having invented the technique. Works by Van Eyck are rare and very seldom lent between museums; this exhibition will represent a once-in-a-lifetime gathering of masterpieces, including works by Van Eyck, his assistants and closest followers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fa8583e9ad88a617dac4f97dd73d1616fa21632","amp;dn":"Recognizing+Van+Eyck+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fa8583e9ad88a617dac4f97dd73d1616fa21632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,168,88,62,154,216,138,97,125,172,79,151,221,115,209,97,111,162,22,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
