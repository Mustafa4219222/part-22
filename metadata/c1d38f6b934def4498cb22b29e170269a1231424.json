A second GENOCIDE album, &amp;#039;Showtime&amp;#039; produced by KROKUS veteran Jurg Naegeli, surfaced in 1992. Signing to major label BMG the group scored the support tour to KROKUS in 1995 promoting third album &amp;#039;Stranded&amp;#039;. \n\nThe revised band title of SIDEBURN was adopted during 1997 for the &amp;#039;Sell Your Soul To Rock n&amp;#039; Roll&amp;#039; album. A single, the Christoph Alispach produced &amp;#039;Get That Way&amp;#039;, would include three live tracks recorded in Einsideln during May of 1995. The band veered off sharply into a new musical direction of high energy Rock and pulled in Jurg Naegeli once more to produce the &amp;#039;Crocodile&amp;#039; album. This record included a cover version of ROSE TATTOO&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Remedy&amp;#039;. SIDEBURN returned in May 2004 with the &amp;#039;Gasoline&amp;#039; album, once again seeing Jurg Naegeli as producer. SIDEBURN saw changes in 2005 as guitarist David Pariat was replaced by Boris. \n\nThe December 2006 compilation album &amp;#039;Archives 1990 - 2006&amp;#039; included a new recording in a cover version of CREEDANCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Up Around The Bend&amp;#039;.&quot;\n\n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1d38f6b934def4498cb22b29e170269a1231424","amp;dn":"Sideburn+-+Sell+Your+Soul+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1d38f6b934def4498cb22b29e170269a1231424","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,211,143,107,147,77,239,68,152,203,34,178,158,23,2,105,161,35,20,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
