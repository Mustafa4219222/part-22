For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nAnyway. This is Larry's first solo album. It contains such gems as &quot;I Wish We'd All Been Ready&quot;, a mellow but strong wakeup-call, and &quot;Sweet Song Of Salvation&quot; (&quot;It got sung in many churches 'till they realized who wrote it&quot; Larry said..:-)), &quot;I Don't Believe In Miracles&quot; and &quot;Forget Your Hexagram&quot;, maybe more important and up to date than intended in 1969.. \n\nPlease enjoy and maybe cry a tear or two..\n\nIn Memory of Larry Norman (1947-2008)\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5c2a392e353a352e39313d35301c3b313d3530723f3331&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f424d1de6392921dd636c5e2e082c4cec090b132","amp;dn":"Larry+Norman+-+Upon+This+Rock+%281969%29%40160","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f424d1de6392921dd636c5e2e082c4cec090b132","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,36,209,222,99,146,146,29,214,54,197,226,224,130,196,206,192,144,177,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
