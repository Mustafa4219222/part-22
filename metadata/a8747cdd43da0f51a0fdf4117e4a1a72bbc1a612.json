Produced by longtime Norman Whitfield associate Frank Wilson, the album returned the Four Tops to the top forty on the album charts where it peaked at number twenty-one on the albums chart yielding the popular Top 30 hits, &quot;Still Water (Love)&quot; (#11), which was co-written by Smokey Robinson and their cover of &quot;It's All in the Game&quot; (#24), which featured rare co-leads by Four Tops members Abdul &quot;Duke&quot; Fakir, Renaldo &quot;Obie&quot; Benson and Lawrence Payton singing alongside prominent lead Levi Stubbs. The album also served as inspiration behind singer Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, the hit title track, which was written by Benson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8747cdd43da0f51a0fdf4117e4a1a72bbc1a612","amp;dn":"Four+Tops+-+Still+Waters+Run+Deep+%5B1970%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8747cdd43da0f51a0fdf4117e4a1a72bbc1a612","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,116,124,221,67,218,15,81,160,253,244,17,126,74,26,114,187,193,166,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
