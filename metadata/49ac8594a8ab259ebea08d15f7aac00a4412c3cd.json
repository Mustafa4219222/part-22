Landau (screenplay), and 1 more credit Ã‚Â»\nStars:  John Bromfield, Carol Shannon and Joi Lansing\nAVI\nruntime: 1 hr. 41 mins.\n\n\nHere is the squib from IMDb:\n\n A salt-of-earth family man needs money for his sick son, and decides to keep a job at a used car lot despite realizing it is selling stolen cars.\n\n\n\nMy notes:\n\n   While reading the wiki notes on Joi Lansing who was a supporting player in many films of the 50's I learned that one of the few films in which she had a featured role was Hot Cars.  I tracked it down as a DVD (it's currently available as I write this).  Nostalgia for glamour is something I've explored in my film viewing.  Many years ago Joi Lansing had a spot on a daytime situation comedy starring Bob Cummings.  I never forgot Joi Lansing.\n\n  The wiki notes are worht persuing for this reason:  Though Joi Lansing is a bombshell with a type of beauty I have not seen since, her life was quite conservative.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Lansing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joi_Lansing&lt;/a&gt;\n\n  On the film itself;  it was filmed on site at a car dealership for many scenes. The nostalgia for old vehicles also plays into the view on the 1950's.\n\nThis torrent has been remade since the demise of another large indexing site.  Enjoy Hot Cars and help keep it seeded across other indexes.\n\n\n\n   \n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49ac8594a8ab259ebea08d15f7aac00a4412c3cd","amp;dn":"Hot+Cars+%281956%29+starring+John+Bromfield+and+Joi+Lansing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49ac8594a8ab259ebea08d15f7aac00a4412c3cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,172,133,148,168,171,37,158,190,160,141,21,247,170,192,10,68,18,195,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
