Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\nI first read about this in the Whole Earth Catalog about a million years ago, and never forgot the description. But I never actually saw the book until today, and voila! a scan is available.\n\nYes, it's a little weird. It has something to do with the spiritual journey as understood by a Gurdjieff disciple. To tell you more, I'll have to read it myself.\n\n\ndescription:\n\nIn this novel/allegory the narrator/author sets sail in the yacht Impossible to search for Mount Analogue, the geographically located, albeit hidden, peak that reaches inexorably toward heaven. Daumal's symbolic mountain represents a way to truth that &quot;cannot not exist,&quot; and his classic allegory of man's search for himself embraces the certainty that one can know and conquer one's own reality.In this novel/allegory the narrator/author sets sail in the yacht Impossible to search for Mount Analogue, the geographically located, albeit hidden, peak that reaches inexorably toward heaven.
