Each of the principals get some solo space, giving this release more variety than one might expect. In addition there are two bonus cuts from a Buddy Rich date that feature the drummer with trumpeters Thad Jones and Joe Newman, tenors Ben Webster and Frank Wess, Oscar Peterson, Ray Brown, and rhythm guitarist Freddie Green. Excellent music overall if not quite essential.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ee06f4b3e99ccc3ba5ef58327806a718a32a748","amp;dn":"Krupa+and+Rich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ee06f4b3e99ccc3ba5ef58327806a718a32a748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,224,111,75,62,153,204,195,186,94,245,131,39,128,106,113,138,50,167,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
