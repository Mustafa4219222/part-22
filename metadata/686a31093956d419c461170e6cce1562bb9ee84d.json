And how does gender enter the stage? This book identifies frequently used key arguments in gender discussions on management and organizations and will unmask them as myths. Be it that management is rational, be it that organizations are gender-neutral, be it that women will change technology, will be shown to be a set of superficial declarations not withstanding critical scrutiny. All the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreasonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for gender-specific organizational phenomena will be proved to exist simply to maintain power structures and thereby systematically (but subtly) reproduce dominant organizational cultures and stabilize taken-for-granted knowledge in particular with respect to gender issues.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:686a31093956d419c461170e6cce1562bb9ee84d","amp;dn":"The+Triple+M+of+Organizations+-+Man%2C+Management+%26+Myth+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"686a31093956d419c461170e6cce1562bb9ee84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,106,49,9,57,86,212,25,196,97,23,14,108,206,21,98,187,158,232,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
