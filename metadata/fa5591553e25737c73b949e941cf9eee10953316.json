Shiva has risen yet again to destroy the evildoers. The last of the Shiva Trilogy, this book promises to keep the readers gripped while the great warrior discovers who his true enemies are and gives it his all to destroy them.\n\nSummary of the Book\n\nThe Oath of the Vayuputras is the final book of the Shiva Trilogy. In the earlier books of the trilogy, Shiva finds out that the Nagas are not his enemies and joins hands with them to reach the root of all evil. This book will have answers to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe NeelkanthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ questions about his fate, the choices he made previously and karma.\n\nFurther, in the concluding book of the trilogy, Shiva reaches Panchavati, the capital of Naga where he will come face to face with his greatest enemy. Will he win the battle over his wicked enemies, who are out to destroy him and his legacy?\n\nThe Oath of the Vayuputras will also reveal the reason of ShivaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s close friend BrahaspatiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disappearance and reappearance at the end of the second book, The Secret of the Nagas. Further the relationship between Daksha, the king of Meluha and the mysterious temple priests will also be exposed in this last part of the trilogy. Shiva seeks helps from the Vayuputras in the quest to conquer all evil.\n\nThe great warrior will encounter the real intentions of some characters he deemed to be close to him. Some new characters will add that extra vitality to the entire plot, especially ShivaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest enemy whose name sends shivers down the spines of many great warriors.\n\nAn interesting journey of a warrior who is turned into a God by his followers because of his deeds and war against the evil, this book is sure to have its readersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ full attention. A good read which will make one reflect on their actions, this book like the two earlier books of the trilogy focuses on philosophy, religion and the never ending battle between the good and the evil.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa5591553e25737c73b949e941cf9eee10953316","amp;dn":"The+Oath+of+The+Vayuputras_rahul22691","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa5591553e25737c73b949e941cf9eee10953316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,85,145,85,62,37,115,124,115,185,73,233,65,207,158,238,16,149,51,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
