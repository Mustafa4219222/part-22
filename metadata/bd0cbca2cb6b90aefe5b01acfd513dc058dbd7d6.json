Buoyed by their acclaim from their first Elektra album, as well as their association withÃ‚Â Eric Clapton, the group switched record labels and recorded this, probably their most definitive album. Backed by an awesome cast of musicians which includedÃ‚Â Jim GordonÃ‚Â (drums),Kenny GradneyÃ‚Â (bass -- later ofÃ‚Â Little Feat), and many others, this record shows why anyone connected with the band became a tambourine-shaking convert to soul-based rhythm &amp; blues rock. Some great vocal performances byÃ‚Â Bonnie Bramlett, especially the low-down &quot;The Love of My Man,&quot; show why she was put in the same league asÃ‚Â Janis Joplin. One of the more definitive albums of the period.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Delaney-Bonnie-Friends-To-Bonnie-From-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Delaney-Bonnie-Friends-To-Bonnie-From-&lt;/a&gt;\nDelaney/release/1199428\n\nGrabbed from the original APE files found here and converted to FLAC via XLD by daltontrumbo 12/1/13 -- \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0cbca2cb6b90aefe5b01acfd513dc058dbd7d6","amp;dn":"To+Bonnie+From+Delaney+1970","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0cbca2cb6b90aefe5b01acfd513dc058dbd7d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,12,188,162,203,107,144,174,254,91,1,172,253,81,61,192,88,219,215,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
