Potentially an endangered language, it has recently, for the first time ever, received recognition and support by the State (e.g. BBC Alba on SKY-channel 168 in the UK) instead of repression and ethnic cleansing. This language gives you access to the vibrant Celtic music scene that has exploded in recent years.\n     \nThis folder contains videos of the twice-weekly episodes, each of approximately 25 minutes long. The BBC regularly re-broadcast the entire series (of about 72 episodes). I will Upload the other Episodes when available.
