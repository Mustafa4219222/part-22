Many of Tammy Wynette's hits dealt with classic themes of loneliness, divorce and the difficulties of male-female relationships. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, she dominated the country charts, scoring 17 number one hits. Along with Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton she defined the role of female country vocalists in the 1970s.\n\nHer 1969 marriage to legendary country singer George Jones (which would end in divorce in 1975) created country music's &quot;first couple.&quot; The pair recorded a series of duet albums and singles, which charted throughout the 1970s, concurrent to their respective solo hits.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0ef6c8fbc09ec122536e577a186c7c56febb601","amp;dn":"Tammy+Wynette+Biggest+Hits++%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0ef6c8fbc09ec122536e577a186c7c56febb601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,239,108,143,188,9,236,18,37,54,229,119,161,134,199,197,111,235,182,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
