This emotional novel portrays the reality of slavery while also stressing that Christian love can defeat something as damaging as enslavement of fellow human beings. Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling book in the 19th century, and second best-selling following the Bible. \n\n\nPublic Domain (P)2010 Hudson Audio Publishing\n\nNarrated by Sean Crisden (one of my personal all time favorite narrators.)\n\nPlease seed and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da32610f1284c081a368f7a181241a86d05f2bed","amp;dn":"Harriet+Beecher+Stowe+-+Uncle+Tom%27s+Cabin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da32610f1284c081a368f7a181241a86d05f2bed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,50,97,15,18,132,192,129,163,104,247,161,129,36,26,134,208,95,43,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
