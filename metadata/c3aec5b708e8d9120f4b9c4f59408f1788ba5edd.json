They come from different sources, I will admit. Some are APE, some are FLAC. Some have high-res art, some do not. Some are single files, some are broken up. But it&amp;#039;s all here!\n\nDays of Future Passed\nIn Search of the Lost Chord\nOn the Threshold of a Dream\nTo Our Children&amp;#039;s Children&amp;#039;s Children\nA Question of Balance\nEvery Good Boy Deserves Favour\nSeventh Sojourn\n\nNow here&amp;#039;s the Plus part: I&amp;#039;ve included the original mix of Days of Future Passed, taken from a Dutch half-speed vinyl from Thom Osburn. If you&amp;#039;ve downloaded this already, download it again. I&amp;#039;ve fixed a tiny error in one track and corrected the pitch across the board. I&amp;#039;ve also included a little piece that explains the differences between the two mixes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3aec5b708e8d9120f4b9c4f59408f1788ba5edd","amp;dn":"The+Moody+Blues+MFSL+Collection+Plus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3aec5b708e8d9120f4b9c4f59408f1788ba5edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,174,197,183,8,232,217,18,15,75,156,79,89,64,143,23,136,186,94,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
