The vivid and terrifying visions that nearly get her killed are a pretty good warning too.\n\nThe giant nine-tailed cat demon that comes after the sword and tries to rip her throat out? Overkill.\n\nSeconds away from becoming kitty-food, Mio is saved by Shinobu, a mysterious warrior boy. But it's already too late. Mio has ruptured the veil between the mortal realm and the Underworld, and now the gods and monsters of ancient Japan stalk the streets of London, searching for her and the sword. \n\nWith the help of her best friend Jack, a fox spirit named Hikaru - and the devoted protection of the betwitchingly familiar Shinobu - Mio attempts to discover the true nature of the sword and its connection to the Yamato family. Because if she doesn't learn how to control the katana's incredible powers, she's in danger of being overwhelmed by them. And if she can't keep the sword safe from the terrible creatures who want it for their own, she'll lose not only her own life... but the love of a lifetime\n\n\nDarkness Hidden\nIn the electrifying second volume of ZoÃƒÂ« Marriott's The Name of the Blade Trilogy, Mio, Jack and Shinobu have defeated the terrifying Nekomata against all odds, and brought Jack's sister home alive. \n\nBut Mio is still compelled to protect the katana, her family's ancestral sword, and now the Underworld has spawned a worse monster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one carrying a devastating plague that sweeps through London like wildfire. \n\nAs Mio struggles to protect the city and control the swordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadly powers, she realises that this time there is no way she can keep everyone she loves alive... and she must make a terrible sacrifice to save the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909a9d291a26f8eb4d4ea4646de263bb94c65e9d","amp;dn":"Name+of+the+Blade+Books+1%26amp%3B2+by+Zoe+Marriott+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909a9d291a26f8eb4d4ea4646de263bb94c65e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,154,157,41,26,38,248,235,77,78,164,100,109,226,99,187,148,198,94,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
