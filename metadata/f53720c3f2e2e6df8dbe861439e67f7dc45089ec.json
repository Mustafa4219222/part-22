The other two are acoustic numbers with Peter RollerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guitar, Peter ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMadcatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ RuthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harmonica wizardry, and, of course, Yank doing his thing. To round out the rest of the band is Leonard Marsh, Jr. on drums and YankÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s granddaughter Sheena Rachell on bass. Not too many instruments, but just enough to make it blue.\nThere is an amazing thing on this album: tempo. Every song keeps your foot tappinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ along no matter where the tempo is. Find a picture of Sleepy John EstesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ house in Brownsville, Tennessee, and you could picture this music coming off the front porch in the mid 1980s. But the bass and drums keep you movinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from song to song no matter how hot that summer got down there\nThis contains fine material by one of the few great mandolin bluesmen.\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
