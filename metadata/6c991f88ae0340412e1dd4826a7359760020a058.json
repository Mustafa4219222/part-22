When star college footballer Ryder Cavanagh comes back to his hometown of Winter, he's supposed to be injured, but there's no sign of a torn ligament. He doesn't even limp. What he does have is a bad attitude that pushes everyone away, including his childhood friend, Jane Merriweather. Seductive. Jane has only ever wanted one thing - to lose her virginity to Ryder. Now he's back and she has a chance. But he's changed. He's not a nice guy anymore. He's cruel and angry, yet still as sexy as sin. Mysterious. Why has Ryder been sent home to torment Jane? And why can't she walk away from him forever?\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c991f88ae0340412e1dd4826a7359760020a058","amp;dn":"Torn+%28Summer+In+Winter%29+-+Scott%2C+C.J_.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c991f88ae0340412e1dd4826a7359760020a058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,153,31,136,174,3,64,65,46,29,212,130,106,115,89,118,0,32,160,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
