During its original run, it was broadcast on the NBC television network.[1] However, it also aired in daily syndication in the early 1980s as part of the &quot;Krofft Superstars&quot; package. In 1985, it returned to late Saturday mornings on CBS as a replacement for the canceled Pryor's Place - also a Krofft production. It was later shown in reruns on the Sci Fi Channel in the 1990s. Re-runs of this series now airs Saturday mornings on Me-TV. It has since become a cult classic and is now available on DVD.[2][3][4] Krofft Productions remade the series in 1991, also titled Land of the Lost, and a big budget film adaptation was released in 2009.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9b732291024008fe1442fea27a499f7aec02d1","amp;dn":"Land_of_the_Lost_Complete_First_Season_MP4_DVD_Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9b732291024008fe1442fea27a499f7aec02d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,155,115,34,145,2,64,8,254,20,66,254,162,122,73,159,122,236,2,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
