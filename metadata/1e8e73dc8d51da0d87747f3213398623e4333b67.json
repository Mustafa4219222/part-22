Their 2004 album, Once, which has sold more than 1 million copies, led to the broadcast of Nightwish video clips on MTV in the United States and inclusion of their music in US movie soundtracks. Their biggest US hit single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWish I Had an AngelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (2004), made it onto three US film soundtracks as a means to promote their North American tour.
