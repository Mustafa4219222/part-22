As Def Leppard settled down to record their fourth album, they had to contend with a drummer who had lost an arm and nearly died, a guitarist with a severe drinking problem, and a producer who was seriously injured in a car crash. But 1987's Hysteria proved the band could overcome any obstacle; the disc became another global smash hit, selling 17 million copies around the world. Def Leppard: Hysteria is a documentary about the often trying production of the album, with producer Robert &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange and band members Rick Allen, Joe Elliot, Rick Savage, and Phil Collen sharing their memories of how the songs were written, the long and difficult recording sessions, and the triumphs and tragedies that happened along the way. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide\n\nDVD Menu\n\n    * Side #1 --\n          o Play\n          o Chapter Selection\n          o Bonus Material\n                + Initial Recordings of 'Animal'\n                + Rick Gets Hysterical\n                + 'Hysteria' (Acoustic)\n                + Drumming- Return to the Status Quo\n                + The Album According to Joe\n                + Sugar Stripped Down\n                + 'Pour Some Sugar on Me' (Acoustic)\n                + Guitars, Guitars, Guitars\n                + Windmill II and the Gods of War\n                + Mutt's Vocals in the Mix\n                + The Album is Finally Released \n\n\n\nDVD Chapters\nSide #1 --\n1.
