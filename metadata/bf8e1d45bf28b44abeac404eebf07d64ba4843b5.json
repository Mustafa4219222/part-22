Finlayson (Wiley, 2006).pdf\n\nISBN 9780471740629\n\nAn innovative introduction to chemical engineering computing\n\nAs chemical engineering technology advances, so does the complexity of the problems that arise. The problemsthat chemical engineers and chemical engineering students face today can no longer be answered with programs written on a case-by-case basis. Introduction to Chemical Engineering Computing teaches professionalsand students the kinds of problems they will have to solve, the types of computer programs needed to solve\n\nthese problems, and how to ensure that the problems have been solved correctly.\n\nEach chapter in Introduction to Chemical Engineering Computing contains a description of the physicalproblem in general terms and in a mathematical context, thorough step-by-step instructions, numerous examples,and comprehensive explanations for each problem and program. This indispensable text features Excel,MATLAB(r), Aspen PlusTM, and FEMLAB programs and acquaints readers with the advantages of each.\n\nPerfect for students and professionals, Introduction to Chemical Engineering Computing gives readers the professional tools they need to solve real-world problems involving:\n* Equations of state\n* Vapor-liquid and chemical reaction equilibria\n* Mass balances with recycle streams\n* Mass transfer equipment\n* Process simulation\n* Chemical reactors\n* Transfer processes in 1D\n* Fluid flow in 2D and 3D\n* Convective diffusion equations in 2D and 3D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf8e1d45bf28b44abeac404eebf07d64ba4843b5","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Chemical+Engineering+Computing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf8e1d45bf28b44abeac404eebf07d64ba4843b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,142,29,69,191,40,180,74,190,172,64,78,235,240,125,100,186,72,67,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
