It is Cracked, Serial&amp;#039;d, and ready to play!\n\nKEEP SEEDING!!!\n\nIf you have an existing copy of Hegemonia that you want to make portable, this is also possible. Simply take the &quot;Haegemonia - Legions of Iron Portable.exe&quot; and copy it somewhere; then execute it. You will be asked to import the folder of your existing Haegemonia installation. Before running the game, make sure to include the .reg file either from this torrent (it&amp;#039;s in the data folder) or have one already available to put in the data or root folder of the game. It&amp;#039;s easier to take the one I have, and edit the information to match your previous configuration, even using your old serial if you&amp;#039;d like.\nThe above makes more sense if you go to the site and download the launcher by itself.\n\nPlease visit USBGaming.org!!\n\nFor more information on this game, please visit its information page on my site.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.usbgaming.org/2008/07/haegemonia-legions-of-iron.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.usbgaming.org/2008/07/haegemonia-legions-of-iron.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de008c2838b22f0f5406ce4d1ff350440cefdb7b","amp;dn":"Portable+Haegemonia+%28Hegemonia%29+-+Legions+of+Iron+%5BUSBGaming.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de008c2838b22f0f5406ce4d1ff350440cefdb7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,0,140,40,56,178,47,15,84,6,206,77,31,243,80,68,12,239,219,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
