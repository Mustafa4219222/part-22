Kollberg and Malmsten are thrown together in adversity, since she&amp;#039;s pregnant and homeless, and he has just been released from prison with only spare change in his pocket. An apparently deserted country cottage gives them a chance to set up housekeeping, but the landlord, church and bureaucracy obstruct the couple&amp;#039;s future happiness. Shadowing their path, however, is Cederlund&amp;#039;s omniscient and possibly otherworldly narrator, who acts as surprise counsel for the defence as the lovers&amp;#039; fate is decided in court. His beneficent paternalism and the drawn, faux-naif chapter headings sit uneasily beside the catalogue of misfortunes passing for a plot. Indeed, the film&amp;#039;s jesting quality is almost an admission it might not stand close scrutiny. Look out for Gunnar BjÃƒÂ¶rnstrand&amp;#039;s first Bergman appearance in an unlikely comic role as a silly ass functionary.&quot;\n\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 31mn\n      Bit rate : 2009 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 512 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.233\n      StreamSize : 1.28 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 31mn\n      Bit rate : 255 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 167 MiB\n\nEnglish, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b5e65728eb381c2bb262440f5dfbffa37457b44","amp;dn":"It+Rains+on+Our+Love+%28Det+Regnar+p%C3%A5+v%C3%A5r+K%C3%A4rlek%29+%28eng%2Cesp%2Cptbr%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b5e65728eb381c2bb262440f5dfbffa37457b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,94,101,114,142,179,129,194,187,38,36,64,245,223,191,250,55,69,123,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
