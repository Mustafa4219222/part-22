This very personal anthology of depictions of Greece explores the changing attitude of travelers to Greece from medieval to modern times. \n\nA number of the selections relate to the historic events surrounding the War of Independence, including Lord ByronÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s participation in it, which led to his death. Particular emphasis is given to the German painters of the 1830s and their pupils, who are comparatively little known in the English-speaking world. \n\nFramed by a text describing the relationship of artists to Greece, these images evoke the many moods of the country. The book is enhanced by succinct comments on the illustrations, a biographical index of the artists featured, and an introduction that discusses the development of the painterly approach to Greece","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f896bbeb3805471ce476dcc19f7eff00b72c818a","amp;dn":"A+Luminous+Land+-+Artists+Discover+Greece+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f896bbeb3805471ce476dcc19f7eff00b72c818a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,150,187,235,56,5,71,28,228,118,220,193,159,126,255,0,183,44,129,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
