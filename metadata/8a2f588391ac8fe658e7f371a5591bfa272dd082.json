Cluster\n\nRob Orme, alias Submerse, is a 23-year-old DJ/producer who happens to be making some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful (dance) music anywhere on the planet. And he is all over the planet: he comes from Runcorn in Cheshire, home of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud and not much else, but his twin loves of 2000-era UK garage and Japanese pop, or rather J-pop, took him to Tokyo, where he currently lives and is pioneering a new form of music that caters to a local demand for 2-step rhythms, sad-female vocals and wan melody: J-garage. This essentially combines the skippy, skittering beats and crisp, clean production of UKG with the eerily poignant cries and whispers of young Japanese girls singing ever so cutely about the desolation and devastation of lost love. It works.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a2f588391ac8fe658e7f371a5591bfa272dd082","amp;dn":"Submerse+-+They+Always+Come+Back+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a2f588391ac8fe658e7f371a5591bfa272dd082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,47,88,131,145,172,143,230,88,231,243,113,165,89,27,250,39,45,208,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
