The content, organization, and presentation make this book a unique resource.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Doody's Book Reviews\n\nUntil recently, the indigenous microbiota of humans has been a relatively neglected area of microbiology with most attention being focused on those microbes that cause disease in humans, rather than on those that co-exist with us in the disease-free state. However, in the past decade research has shown that not only is the indigenous microbiota involved in protecting humans from exogenous pathogens but it is also involved in our development and nutrition. Consequently, interest has grown substantially among health professionals and scientists in analyzing and understanding these microbial (largely bacterial) communities.\n\nThis comprehensive, yet accessible text provides an up-to-date guide to the development, composition and distribution of indigenous microbial communities of humans. With the aid of abundant colour figures, diagrams, tables and maps, it establishes links between the physicochemical factors prevailing at an anatomical site and the types of microbes to be found there. The book includes an introduction to the human-microbe symbiosis as well as an in-depth look at the main systems and organs of the human body that have an indigenous microbiota. Each chapter includes a list of references for further study.\n\nThis is an excellent and informative reference book that is useful to anyone with an interest in microbiology, medical microbiology, microbial ecology, infectious diseases, immunology, human biology, medicine, dentistry, nursing, health sciences, biomedical sciences or pharmacy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it should be on the shelf of every major science and medical library.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbdf4e13e3bfde0670a890271bb2a8ce27cc46ef","amp;dn":"Bacteriology+of+Humans+-+An+Ecological+Perspective+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbdf4e13e3bfde0670a890271bb2a8ce27cc46ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,223,78,19,227,191,222,6,112,168,144,39,27,178,168,206,39,204,70,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
