That is hard to say. While the combination of djent/death metal/progressive elements is still there, Aeons seeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the band taking a much more atmospheric, and in a lot of ways (dare I say) doomy approach to the music. If you really want an answer to the question of Is it better?, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d tell you itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equally good in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own right Ã¢â‚¬â€ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saying a lot.\n\n\nAeons will be released digitally and on limited edition CD on November 11\n\n\nQuote:\nPacific NorthwestÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Stealing Axion was formed in the winter of 2009 by guitarists Dan Forbrich, Josh DeShazo, and Phil Willmarth. The three had an instant chemistry, having been lifelong friends, and it was not too long before they began building a library of riffs. By early 2010 they self-recorded and released their EP which rapidly spread across the net and garnered them praise from fans and critics alike. With these songs as a solid foundation, the band maintained a steady regiment of writing and developing their sound and soon were ready to unleash their debut album Moments via InsideOut/Century Media records in August of 2012.\n\nThe band embarked on the Dual Destruction tour with 7 Horns 7 Eyes in preparation for the release in the summer of 2012. They then toured extensively throughout Europe on the first-ever Euroblast tour with Jeff Loomis, Vildhjarta, and Monuments. Once the tour cycle had ended for Moments, it was time to get back to writing for the upcoming followup release &quot;Aeons.&quot;\n\nAeons expands greatly on the foundation that was set by Moments. Mixing and mastering duties this time were handled by Gino Bambino of Bambino Studios. Familiar musical and lyrical themes neatly tie the two albums together, creating one cohesive story. There has been an extreme attention to detail given to subtle layering as well as a massive soundscape of crushing guitars and bass to create a dense yet expansive sonic atmosphere. Interweaving rhythms, polyphonic vocals, distant layers, and time-signature manipulation will surely provide the listener with a lot to absorb, hopefully across multiple listens.\n\nKeep an eye out for the release of the first single Lost Awakening accompanied by a music video filmed and edited by Patrick Haberli.\n\nAeons will be released worldwide 11/11/14 in both physical and digital formats via bandcamp. It will also be available via iTunes/Spotify/Amazon and most other digital music retailers.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. Transcendence\n2. Lost Awakening\n3. Memories\n4. Parallel Futures\n5.
