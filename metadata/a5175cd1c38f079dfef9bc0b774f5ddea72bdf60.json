Rolling Stone magazine included Hopkins at number 71 on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. His distinctive fingerstyle playing often included playing, in effect, bass, rhythm, lead, percussion, and vocals, all at the same time.Tapping or slapping the body of his guitar added rhythmic accompaniment. Many of his songs were in the talking blues style, but he was a powerful and confident singer. Lyrically his songs chronicled the problems of life in the segregated south, bad luck in love and other usual subjects of the blues idiom. He did however deal with these subjects with humor and good nature. Many of his songs are filled with double entendres and he was known for his humorous introductions. Hopkins died of esophageal cancer in Houston January 30, 1982, at the age of 69. His New York Times obituary named him as &quot;one of the great country blues and perhaps the greatest single influence on rock guitar players.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   HISTORY OF POP AND ROCK MUSIC \n\n\n\n03. BLUES \n\n\n\nImportant source of modern rock'n'roll, absolutely essential to the sound we think of as 60's rock, was, first, the Blues. Blues has evolved from an unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of African-American slaves (imported from West Africa; principally present day Mali, Senegal, the Gambia and Ghana).\nBlues began as the music of black sharecroppers in the poor cotton-farming region of the Mississippi Delta, and traveled north to Chicago with the sharecroppers as thousands of them moved north in search of a better life. It was in Chicago that the blues went from acoustic solo guitar music to electric guitar-electric bass-drums combos.\nBlues can be subdivided into several subgenres ranging from country to urban blues that were more or less popular during different periods of the 20th century. Best known are the Delta, Piedmont, Jump and Chicago blues styles. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called blues rock evolved.\n\n03.01 Delta Blues \n\nThe Delta blues is one of the earliest styles of blues music. Guitar and harmonica are the dominant instruments used. &quot;Delta blues&quot; is a style as much as a geographical appellation: Skip James and Elmore James, who were not born in the Delta, were considered Delta blues musicians. Performers traveled throughout the Mississippi Delta, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Tennessee. Eventually, Delta blues spread out across the country, giving rise to a host of regional variations, including &quot;Chicago blues&quot; and &quot;Detroit blues&quot;. Muddy Waters, Little Milton, B.B. King, and Howlin' Wolf were just a few of these important Chicago blues artists. \nList of Delta Blues artists : Ishman Bracey ,Willie Brown, Robert Johnson, Tommy Johnson, Blind Willie Johnson ,Paul Jones, Sam Chatmon ,Bob Cobb, James Cotton ,Mike Cross , Arthur Crudup, CeDell Davis, David Honeyboy Edwards , Earl Hooker , John Lee Hooker Son House , Mississippi John Hurt ,Skip James , Jimmie Rodgers , Charley Patton, Pinetop Perkins, Snooky Pryor, Johnny Shines, Sunnyland Slim, Henry Sloan, Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith, Howlin' Wolf ........\n\n\nCHARLIE PATTON - MOON GOING DOWN (1926)\nBLIND WILLIE JOHNSON - TROUBLE WILL SOON BE OVER (1927)\nLEAD BELLY - LORD LORD LORD (1929)\nSKIP JAMES - HARD TIME KILLING FLOOR BLUES (1931)\nJAMES (Iron Head) BAKER - BLACK BETTY (1933)\nROBERT JOHNSON - SWEET HOME CHICAGO (1936)\nROBERT JOHNSON - LOVE IN VAIN (1937)\nROBERT JOHNSON - CROSSROAD BLUES (1937) \nLEADBELLY - BLACK BETTY (1939)\nLEAD BELLY - PICK A BALE OF COTTON \nLEAD BELLY - TAKE THIS HAMMER \nEDDIE JAMES SON HOUSE - LEVEE CAMP BLUES \nBIG JOE WILLIAMS - LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME \nBIG JOE WILLIAMS - BABY PLEASE DON'T GO (1963) \nJOHN LEE HOOKER - TUPELO, MISSISSIPPI \nJOHN LEE HOOKER - I'LL NEVER GET OUT OF THESE BLUES ALIVE \nDAVID HONEYBOY EDWARDS - GAMBLIN' MAN \n\n\n03.02. Country blues\n\nCountry blues, which is also known as &quot;folk blues,&quot; is a primarily an acoustic guitar-oriented type of blues from which many other styles are derived. It often incorporated elements of gospel, ragtime, hillbilly, and Dixieland jazz. The popularity and hit records of original country blues artists like Mississippi's Charley Patton, or Blind Lemon Jefferson from Texas would subsequently influence scores of musicians across the Southern United States. \nIn the Carolinas and Georgia, artists like Blind Boy Fuller and Brownie McGhee added a fingerpicking guitar technique to create the Piedmont blues style.\nThe Memphis acoustic blues sound developed out of the city's jugband and vaudeville traditions, and was defined by artists like Furry Lewis and Will Shade.\nChicago was originally a hotbed of country blues, as first generation artists like Tampa Red, Big Bill Broonzy, and Memphis Minnie brought their acoustic style to the big city before the popularity of amplified instrumentation transformed the sound of the city into what today we consider the &quot;classic&quot; Chicago blues sound. Chicago's country blues relied heavily on what is called the &quot;hokum&quot; style, a lighthearted sound that often included double-entendre lyrics. Ragtime and Dixieland jazz also influenced the early Chicago blues sound.\nIn Texas during the 1920s and '30s, acoustic bluesmen were developing a style that offered rich, more complex guitar parts, the beginnings of a blues trend towards separating lead guitar from rhythm playing. Texas acoustic blues relied more on the use of slide, and artists like Lightnin' Hopkins and Blind Willie Johnson are considered masters of slide guitar.\n\nSix Pioneering Country Blues Artists : Bukka White, Furry Lewis, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Mississippi John Hurt, Sam Lightnin' Hopkins and Skip James\n\nBIG BILL BROONZY - Hey Hey (1957)\nBIG BILL BROONZY - How You Want It Done (1957)\nBIG BILL BROONZY - Worried Man Blues (1957)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - Baby Please Don't Go (1960)\nMISSISSIPPI JOHN HURT - Candy Man (1964)\nMISSISSIPPI JOHN HURT - Lonesome Valley (1965)\nMISSISSIPPI JOHN HURT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Spike Driver Blues (1966)\nSKIP JAMES - All night Long (1966)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - That Woman Named Mary (1967)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - How Long Have It Been Since You Been Home (1967)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - Mr Charlie (1967)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - Meet Me in the Bottom (1967)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - Instrumental (1967)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - Couldn't be Satisfied (1970)\nLIGHTIN' HOPKINS - Ain't It Crazy (1970)\n\n\n\n03.03. Piedmont blues (East Coast blues) \n\nPiedmont blues (also known as East Coast blues) refers primarily to a guitar style, the Piedmont fingerstyle, which is characterized by a fingerpicking approach in which a regular, alternating thumb bass string rhythmic pattern supports a syncopated melody using the treble strings generally picked with the fore-finger, occasionally others. The Piedmont style is differentiated from other styles, particularly the Mississippi Delta blues, by its ragtime-based rhythms. It was a nationally popular with the African-American audience for about twenty years from the mid-1920s through to the mid-1940s. \nList of Piedmont blues musicians: Pink Anderson,Etta Baker,Barbecue Bob, Blind Blake, Cephas &amp; Wiggins,Elizabeth Cotten, Floyd Council, Reverend Gary Davis, Blind Boy Fuller, Peg Leg Howell, Luke Jordan, Carl Martin, Brownie McGhee, Blind Willie McTell, William Moore, Buddy Moss,Lesley Riddle,Bumble Bee Slim, Baby Tate, Sonny Terry,Willie Walker, Curley Weaver,Josh WhiteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.. \n\n\nREVEREND GARY DAVIS - DEATH DONÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T HAVE NO MERCY\nREVEREND GARY DAVIS - CHILDERN OF ZION \n\n\n\n\n\n03.04. North Mississippi hill country blues\n\nis a regional offshoot of country blues style characterized by few chord changes, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on the &quot;groove&quot; or a steady, driving rhythm (sometimes referred to as a &quot;drone&quot; style). Mississippi Fred McDowellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performances would help define the hill country blues sound, strongly influencing later artists like R. L. Burnside and Junior Kimbrough. Burnside and Kimbrough would go on to popularize this sound through the Fat Possum Records label.\n\nMISSISSIPPI FRED McDOWELL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Shake ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em on Down\nR.L.

Chicago, Detroid and St. Louis blues styles \n\nAfter World War II and in the 1950s, new styles of electric blues music became popular in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis. Electric blues used amplified electric guitars, electric bass, drums, and harmonica played through a microphone. \n\nDetroit blues is blues music played by musicians resident in Detroit, Michigan, particularly that played in the 1940s and 1950s. Detroit blues originated when Delta blues performers migrated north from the Mississippi Delta and Memphis, Tennessee to work in Detroit's industrial plants in the 1920s and 1930s. Typical Detroit blues was very similar to Chicago blues in style. The sound was distinguished from Delta blues by its use of electric amplified instruments and a more eclectic assortment of instruments, including the bass guitar and piano. The only Detroit blues performer to achieve national fame is John Lee Hooker, as record companies and promoters have tended to ignore the Detroit scene in favor of the larger, more influential Chicago blues.\n\nJOHN LEE HOOKER - I'M LEAVING (1964)\nDR. ISAIAH ROSS - Feel So Good (1965)\n\n\n\nChicago became a center for electric blues in the early 1950s. Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Mississippi blues style, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region. Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the Great Migration. Talents like Tampa Red, Big Bill Broonzy, and Memphis Minnie were among the first generation of Chicago blues artists, and they paved the way (and often lent valuable support) for newcomers like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and Willie Dixon. During the decade of the 1950s, Chicago blues ruled the R&amp;B charts, and the style has heavily influenced soul, rhythm &amp; blues, and rock music to this day.\n\n\nTHE HOWLIN' WOLF - SMOKESTACK LIGHTNIN' (1956)\nMUDDY WATERS - YOU CAN'T LOSE WHAT YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD \nMUDDY WATERS - GOT MY MOJO WORKING (1963)\nWILLIE DIXON - WEAK BRAIN AND NARROW MIND (1964)\nTHE HOWLIN' WOLF - SHAKE IT FOR ME (1964) \nJ.B.LENOIR - I FEEL SO GOOD (1964)\nJ.B.LENOIR - SLOW DOWN (1964)\nTHE HOWLIN' WOLF - DUST MY BROOM (1966)\nTHE HOWLIN' WOLF - HOW MANY MORE YEARS (1966)\nBUDDY GUY - HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN (1969) \nMUDDY WATERS - HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN (1972)\n\n\n\n\n03.06. British blues \n\nThe style of British blues developed in the UK, when bands such as Fleetwood Mac, John May all &amp; the Blues breakers, The Rolling Stones, The Yard birds, and Cream performed classic blues songs from the Delta or Chicago blues traditions.\n\n\nTHE ROLLING STONES - LITTLE RED ROOSTER (1964)\nTHE YARDBIRDS (with Eric Clapton) - I WISH YOU WOULD (1964)\nFLEETWOOD MAC - MY HEART BEAT LIKE A HAMMER (1968)\n\n\n\n03.07.
