The film has none of the original cast, nor storyline continuation, from either Troll film. An early script was made with the original cast in mind. In one scene in a bar, a banjo centric song from Troll 2 can be heard in the background.\n\nEnjoy this marvellous piece of shit, everyone!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14fd95e20d16d234a918f5ffcb68ec52dcf90c57","amp;dn":"Troll+3+AKA+Contamination+.7+AKA+Creepers+AKA+Crawlers+%5B1990%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14fd95e20d16d234a918f5ffcb68ec52dcf90c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,253,149,226,13,22,210,52,169,24,245,255,203,104,236,82,220,249,12,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
