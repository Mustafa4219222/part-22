Drawing on new research, Les Standiford vividly captures the larger-then-life engineer and the breathtaking scope of his six-year, $23 million project that would transform a region, a state, and a nation at the dawn of its greatest century.\n\nWith energy and colorful detail, Water to the Angels brings to life the personalities, politics, and powerÃ¢â‚¬â€including bribery, deception, force, and bicoastal financial warfareÃ¢â‚¬â€behind this dramatic event. At a time when the importance of water is being recognized as never beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€considered by many experts to be the essential resource of the twenty-first centuryÃ¢â‚¬â€Water to the Angels brings into focus the vigor of a fabled era, the might of a larger than life individual, and the scale of a priceless construction project, and sheds critical light on a past that offers insights for our future","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3153246ce98b64050a56972f71ee19dbb47b59d5","amp;dn":"Water+To+The+Angels+-+Les+Standiford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3153246ce98b64050a56972f71ee19dbb47b59d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,83,36,108,233,139,100,5,10,86,151,47,113,238,25,219,180,123,89,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
