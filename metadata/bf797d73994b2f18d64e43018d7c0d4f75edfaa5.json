Na Hong-jinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Yellow Sea, a South Korean box-office hit making its North American debut at SIFF 2011, runs with the concept in a jittery thriller of a desperate taxi driver in Yanji (an autonomous region in Northern China dominated by ethnic Koreans) hired to kill a man in South Korea. Gu-nam (Ha Jung-woo) is Joseonjok, a Chinese citizen of Korean ancestry living in the impoverished region across the border. His wife hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t contacted him since she left to work in Korea six months ago, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deep in debt to the gangsters who smuggled her across the channel (the Yellow Sea of the title) and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s losing whatever he makes gambling at Mahjong. So a local crime boss, Myung (Kim Yun-seok), makes him an offer: wipe his debt clean in exchange for a simple murder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf797d73994b2f18d64e43018d7c0d4f75edfaa5","amp;dn":"Yellow.Sea.2010.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-shinostarr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf797d73994b2f18d64e43018d7c0d4f75edfaa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,121,125,115,153,75,47,24,214,78,67,1,141,124,13,79,117,237,250,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
