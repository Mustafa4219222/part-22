Set in an large unnamed Indian city (shot in Bangalore), the film is based on the king-for-a-day story. The film is notable for its inventive recasting of the silent movie form. This movie was released in Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada and Malayalam. Though shot in color and featuring incidental noise, the film does not have any dialogues. However, unlike classic silent movies, the film has very little mouthing of dialog; instead, clever cinematography, implicit and physical communication, and creating scenes or shots where a dialog would plausibly be absent are used. Additionally, crafty camera placement is sometimes employed to rationalize the inaudibility of dialog. It won the 1988 National Film Award for Best Popular Film.\n\n   General\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.23 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 5mn\n      Bit rate : 1401 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.8 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 28312/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 5\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 5mn\n      Bit rate : 1267 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.134\n      StreamSize : 1.11 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 2h 5mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video0 delay : 24ms\n      StreamSize : 113 MiB\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nIMDB: tt0251355\n\nPosted at Secret-cinema by nyk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f51a224ae1c251ec8bd1a03dfc71000e3e7dfdf8","amp;dn":"Pushpak+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f51a224ae1c251ec8bd1a03dfc71000e3e7dfdf8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,26,34,74,225,194,81,236,139,209,160,61,252,113,0,14,62,125,253,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
