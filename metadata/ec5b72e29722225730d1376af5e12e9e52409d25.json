Are rights bestowed by government, or do we possess them simply because we are human? Do we have a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to all things we need for a full human lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even if it obligates others to provide them?\n\nThe Morality in Our Age series examines the historical and philosophical background of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most pressing moral challenges. Though a final ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanswerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is notoriously elusive in moral discussion, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll develop a much better insight into the forces and principles at play on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most serious moral issues, problems, and dilemmas.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5b72e29722225730d1376af5e12e9e52409d25","amp;dn":"Human+Rights+and+Civil+Rights+%28Unabridged%29.m4b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5b72e29722225730d1376af5e12e9e52409d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,91,114,226,151,34,34,87,48,209,55,106,245,225,46,158,82,64,157,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
