She has worked with Sarah McLachlan among other well-known artists. In 2004, the press also reported that Jorane would appear on a Halloween special of the television series ZeD to perform a &quot;witchy acid cello&quot;.\nShe has released five full-length albums. Her most recent album is Vers ÃƒÂ  soi (2007) and her first mostly in the English language is The You And The Now (2005). She is now working on a web project named &quot;Canvas or Canvass?&quot;.\n\n***If you like the album, please buy it***","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c35107ab36065c7b51cba8579761c87a1831c45e","amp;dn":"Jorane+-+Evapore+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c35107ab36065c7b51cba8579761c87a1831c45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,81,7,171,54,6,92,123,81,203,168,87,151,97,200,122,24,49,196,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
