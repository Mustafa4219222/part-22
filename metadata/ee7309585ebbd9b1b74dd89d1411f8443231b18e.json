The film focuses on renowned crime writer Agatha Christie, offering a theory as to her still unsolved 12-day disappearance in 1926.\n\n  Dustin Hoffman  ...  Wally Stanton  \n  Vanessa Redgrave  ...  Agatha Christie  \n  Timothy Dalton  ...  Col. Archibald Christie  \n  Helen Morse  ...  Evelyn Crawley  \n  Celia Gregory  ...  Nancy Neele  \n  Paul Brooke  ...  John Foster  \n  Carolyn Pickles  ...  Charlotte Fisher  \n  Timothy West  ...  Kenward  \n\nIt tells of 11 mystery days in 1926 when the novelist, distraught because her husband wanted a divorce, disappeared from view and checked into a health spa under the name of her husband's mistress.\n\nThe official explanation for the episode was &quot;insomnia,&quot; and the event is ignored in Christie's autobiography. But how much explanation do we need? Her disappearance, her pseudonym and her behavior are easily accounted for by the crisis she was facing. We might not have acted that way ourselves, but we can understand why someone else would have.\n\nAgatha is a visually rich movie filmed exquisitely by Vittorio Storro and pleasantly scored by Robert Mandel. Superstars Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman are paired as the two unlikely companions.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee7309585ebbd9b1b74dd89d1411f8443231b18e","amp;dn":"Agatha+%5B1979%5D+Vanessa+Redgrave","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee7309585ebbd9b1b74dd89d1411f8443231b18e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,115,9,88,94,187,217,177,183,77,216,157,20,17,248,68,50,49,177,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
