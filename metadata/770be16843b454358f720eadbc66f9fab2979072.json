It was directed by Sidney Lumet and stars Sean Connery, Dyan Cannon, Martin Balsam, and comedian Alan King. The screenplay was written by Frank Pierson, based upon a best-selling 1970 novel of the same name by Lawrence Sanders. The film is scored by Quincy Jones.\n\nRevolving around a bold robbery, the film was prescient in focusing on the pervasiveness of electronic surveillance, from security cameras in public places to more discreet and underhanded methods, the first film to do so. This theme would become a movie staple following the Watergate scandal a few years later. It also addressed the lack of coordination between government agencies.\n\nA thief (Duke Anderson) just released from ten years in jail, takes up with his old girlfriend (Ingrid) in her posh apartment. He makes plans to rob the entire building. What he doesn't know is that his every move is recorded on audio and video tape, although he is not the subject of any surveillance.\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCTION\nThe Anderson Tapes was filmed on location in New York City, on Fifth Avenue, at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Riker's Island Prison, the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Luxor Health Club and on the Lower East Side. Interiors scenes were filmed at Hi Brown Studio and ABC-PathÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Studio, both in New York City. The production was on a tight budget, and filming was completed in the short period of six weeks, from mid-August to 16 October 1970. The film was the first for producer Robert M. Weitman as an independent producer.\n\nColumbia Pictures was not happy with the planned ending of the film, in which Connery escaped to be pursued by police helicopters, fearing that it would hurt sales to television, which generally required that bad deeds not go unpunished.\n\n\nTRIVIA\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢This was the first major motion picture for Christopher Walken, as well as the last on-screen film appearance by Margaret Hamilton.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sean Connery, Martin Balsam, and director Sidney Lumet were to work together again on Murder on the Orient Express. Connery had previously worked with the director on The Hill, and they would reunite the following year on The Offence, and again many years later for Family Business. Balsam and Lumet had worked together previously on 12 Angry Men.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sean Connery's performance as the likeable criminal Duke Anderson was instrumental in his breakout from being typecast as James Bond. It also restored him to the ranks of top male actors in the U.S.A.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Two characters from the novel the film was based on were combined together for the film. &quot;Ingrid Macht&quot; and &quot;Agnes Everleigh&quot; became &quot;Ingrid Everleigh&quot;.\n\n\n    * Dyan Cannon .......
