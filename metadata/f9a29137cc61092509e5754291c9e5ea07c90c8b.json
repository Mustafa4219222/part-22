From the artist colony of Fort Collins, Colorado, SHEL is sophisticated and youthful, emotional and lighthearted, classic and eccentric. SHELÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s engaging live show is marked with a prodigyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creativity and a veteranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instinct for entertaining. Audiences delight with their unique songwriting style and fresh, new sound.\n\nThe Holbrook sisters grew up in a musical household and first appeared on the stage backing their singer-songwriter father, Andrew Holbrook. In 2005, the girls collaborated to form SHEL and now play and write all of their own music. Their new EP, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ When the Dragon Came Down,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was co-produced by SHEL and six-time Grammy award-winner, Brent Maher. The band has attracted the attention of such major media outlets as NPRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“eTown Live,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and ABC.com; toured nationwide playing fairs and festivals including South by Southwest, International Folk Alliance, Lilith Fair, Four Corners Folk Festival and Cornerstone; and had one of their songs featured in GladeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Scented Oil Candles national TV ad campaign.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a29137cc61092509e5754291c9e5ea07c90c8b","amp;dn":"shel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a29137cc61092509e5754291c9e5ea07c90c8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,162,145,55,204,97,9,37,9,229,117,66,145,201,229,234,7,201,12,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
