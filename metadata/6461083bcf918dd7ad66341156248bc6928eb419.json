You don?t need the role-call of success read out ? the 15 million units sold worldwide, the influence of Clannad on the global music scene or the courting by Hollywood for soundtrack treats. What you need to know is not what happened in the past, but what the Irish songstress does next. \n?An Irish Christmas? charts a different course, reviewing the Christmas story through a blend of new tracks and leftfield favourites. From ?God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen? to ?In The Bleak Midwinter?, Moya reworks the classics with an intimacy that restores the personal and the passionate to what have become mumbled, half-remembered musical yarns. In her hands, with layered production that adds inches of fresh, crisp depth and those trademark vocals bringing light to the darkest of nights.\n\nTRACK LISTING   \n1. Carol of the Bells     \n2.
