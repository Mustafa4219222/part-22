After comedic adventures getting into and out of trouble just trying to make enough move to get to Texas, they witness a stagecoach robbery and manage to hold up the outlaws and take back the cash. At that point they have a difference of opinion; the 'good' one Todd Ramsey [Glenn Ford] wants to give it back, the 'bad' one Dan Thomas [William Holden as a fresh 1941 face] wants to keep it and keep going...but goodness wins out, and both are off the hook. The honest one takes a job with the biggest local rancher (who of course has a beautiful and friendly daughter) and the 'bad one stumbles into a different kind of job -- with another rancher who specializes in rustling. They both have heads turned by the lovely lady and the battle of good and evil continues in often comedic circumstances...although a showdown looms. The key to the action is the need to get the entire town/valley's cattle past all the rustlers up to the railroad at Abilene. Many twists and turns in this complicated, comedic and top-notch Western with blockbuster ending that cuts back to core of all good westerns...good men tested by difficult circumstances.\n\nTwo Virginians are heading for a new life in Texas when they witness a stagecoach being held up. They decide to rob the robbers and make off with the loot. To escape a posse, they split up and don't see each other again for a long time. When they do meet up again, they find themselves on different sides of the law. This leads to the increasing estrangement of the two men, who once thought of themselves as brothers. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 843 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 94 mins\nSubtitles: English, Espanol, Japanese\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12e5347f3fcb8622d04b0063c22fc6167b25a0e8","amp;dn":"Texas+%281941%29+Xvid+1cd+-++Western+-Subs+Eng-Jap-Sp+-++William+Hol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12e5347f3fcb8622d04b0063c22fc6167b25a0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,229,52,127,63,203,134,34,208,75,0,99,194,47,198,22,123,37,160,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
