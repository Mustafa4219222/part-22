It covers every major theatre of conflict and the people involved, capturing scenes of mass suffering and individual heroism, military conflict, portraits of leaders, and more. The text provides historical grounding by summarizing the many complex events of the period. World War II was the most intensively photographed conflict in history.

From the mass suffering to the individual heroism, the cruelty to the humanitarianism, the misery to the hope, World War II: A Photographic History features the images and the stories that document this extraordinary period. With its wealth of memorable images, this truly comprehensive book provides an unrivalled overview of a time when three-quarters of the globe went to war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ed02b1c39b2323087f39770ab38915bddf748a3","amp;dn":"World+War+II+-+A+Photographic+History+%28Metro+Book%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ed02b1c39b2323087f39770ab38915bddf748a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,208,43,28,57,178,50,48,135,243,151,112,171,56,145,91,221,247,72,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
