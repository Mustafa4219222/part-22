Burn &quot;Windows.Vista.All.Editions.32bit.Multi.Lang.Retail.Version.uif&quot;\nto dvd. I used magicISO to burn this.  Here is the link of what I used if you need to download it          \n\n&quot;http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3917782/Magic_ISO_Maker_5.4_with_serial&quot;\n\n2. Save &quot;Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator-CLoNY.exe&quot; file on to a flash drive or some where so that it won't get deleted when installing vista.  I just saved it onto a seperate partion. \n\nNote for next step: I highly suggest not upgrading a system and just format and install a fresh copy of Vista. Also check this page &quot;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/systemrequirements.mspx&quot; to determine which version will run best on your machine.  \n\n3. Boot from disc.  When asked to enter product key &quot;DO NOT ENTER KEY!&quot;  Just click &quot;Next&quot; then click &quot;NO&quot; that you do not want to enter a key.  If you do enter a key reboot and reinstall, because the crack will not work if you enter a key.  \n\n3. Once installed and logged in run the &quot;Vista.All.x86.OneClick.Activator-CLoNY.exe&quot;. After it finishes installing it will ask you to &quot;Press any key to reboot.&quot; So press enter and reboot.  \n\n4. The only thing left to do is log in and click on the windows &quot;new&quot; start button on the bottom left and right click on computer.  Then select &quot;properties&quot;. On that window look at the bottom for &quot;Windows Activation&quot;.  Give it a little time to load but it will eventually say &quot;Windows is activated&quot;\n\n5. Explore your new OS. \n\nIf this worked for you please leave a comment with at least a &quot;:)&quot; to let people know that it worked for you. I would appreciate it.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fe7e7b3725e5eeb3912733c140d4a74b5b65bf","amp;dn":"Windows.Vista.All.Versions.x86%2832bit%29.Multi.Lang.with.Clony.Crac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85fe7e7b3725e5eeb3912733c140d4a74b5b65bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,254,126,123,55,37,229,238,179,145,39,51,193,64,212,167,75,91,101,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
