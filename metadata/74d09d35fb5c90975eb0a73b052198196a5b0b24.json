How should we respond to Climate Change? These questions are complex, not least because the responses available to us depend upon who is providing the answers and the particular perspective they take. The economist sees the economic challenges and opportunities of Climate Change; the scientist sees the need to describe and explain Climate Change; the policy-maker and social scientist see Climate Change as a social problem. Therefore, the first step to understanding Climate Change and what we do about it is to see how experts from different disciplines engage with the issue. The second step is to appreciate how our response to Climate Change depends upon the interplay between these different approaches.\n\nThis course offers you an introduction to different disciplinary perspectives on Climate Change to help you think about how Climate Change affects you as an individual, as a member of your local community, as a citizen of your country and as a member of the global community. We have designed the presentations, discussions, activities and assessment tasks in this course to help you understand what Climate Change is and what you Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and we Ã¢â‚¬â€œ should do about it.\n\n\n\nCourse Syllabus::\nThe overall aim of this subject is to provide an introduction to the socio-political, scientific, and economic aspects of the phenomenon known as Climate Change. In doing so it is hoped that the student will emerge with an enhanced ability to analyse claims both about the science itself and the responses that can be made by humanity at present and for the future, based on current scientific data and its predictions over the next decades. \n\nYou will emerge with a broad understanding of the science underpinning the claim that human activity has played a role in causing the current rise in global temperature. You will also develop an awareness of the present and future impact on global communities, the political response to such impacts, and consider basic economic concepts and models that describe a framework in which changes to our use of resources can occur.\n\n\n\nSubject objectives::\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ possess a broad understanding of the science underpinning claims that human activity is an important driver for current global temperature rise\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ have an enhanced appreciation of the predicted impact on the most vulnerable of communities\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ have a greater awareness of the difficulties of reaching a global agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ be able to consider the role that economics and politics plays in driving change in human behaviour in relation to the climate problem.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended Background::\nNo background is necessary. This subject is designed to be accessible to students from any discipline.\n\n\n\n\nCourse overview::\nWeek one: vulnerability\n1.1 Introduction (2:33)\n1.2 Climate change: the context (9:15)\n1.3 Climate change is a social problem (12:14)\n1.4 Vulnerability (14:20)\n1.5 Climate change in the South Pacific (14:54)\n1.6 Climate change and development in the South Pacific (15:32)\n1.7 Risks to culture, populations, and nations (15:40)\n1.8 Climate change and forced migration from Tuvalu (8:31)\n1.9 Adaptive capacity (16:43)  Discussion forums for 1.9 Adaptive capacity (16:43)\n1.10 Vulnerability to climate change in Niue (22:00)\n1.11 Land tenure and social vulnerability to flooding in Tonga (20:10)\n1.12 Vulnerability in the Pacific Islands revisited (14:33)\n\n\nWeek two: adaptation\n2.1 Adaptation (19:17)\n2.2 Barriers to adaptation (15:54)\n2.3 Maladaptation (12:15)\n2.4 The limits to adaptation (11:02)\n2.5 Adaptation in practice I: tanks and toilets in Tuvalu (1:43)\n2.6 Adaptation in practice II: after cyclone Heta in Niue (19:33)\n2.7 Mobility as adaptation (19:18)  Discussion forums for 2.7 Mobility as adaptation (19:18)\n2.8 Financing adaptation in the Pacific Islands (32:48)\n\n\n\n\nFAQ\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What resources will I need for this class?\nThere are three kinds of resources you will find useful in this subject. \n\nFirstly, there are the collection of readings that have been chosen by each of the instructors in this subject to help support your discussions and assignment work. These will be made available to you electronically.\n\nSecondly, there are the resources available to you in the many and varied texts on climate change in the public domain (social media, news sources, periodicals, literature, film, works of art, etc.). Although these should be examined critically before being incorporated into the arguments you make, they do give you access to information about current and rapidly changing events.\n\nFinally, there are your own experiences and interests. Draw upon these in your discussions, debates and assignments. \n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What is the coolest thing I'll learn if I take this class?\nYou will learn that the issue of Climate Change is incredibly complex, however it can also be very accessible if you can see it from different perspectives and approach it with an open mind and a willingness to engage in discussion and action along with others.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Will I get a Statement of Accomplishment after completing this class?\n\nA Statement of Accomplishment will be offered to those students who successfully pass the assessments as laid out in the syllabus. A verified Statement of Accomplishment will be offered to those students who enroll in the course using Signature Track and who successfully pass the assessments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74d09d35fb5c90975eb0a73b052198196a5b0b24","amp;dn":"Climate+Change-KTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74d09d35fb5c90975eb0a73b052198196a5b0b24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,208,157,53,251,92,144,151,94,176,167,59,5,33,152,25,106,91,11,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
