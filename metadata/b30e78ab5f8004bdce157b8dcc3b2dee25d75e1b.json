First he falls foul of a local clan that has terrified an entire county into submission. But it's the unsolved case of a missing child, already decades-old, that Reacher can't let go.\nThe Duncans want Reacher gone - and it's not just past secrets they're trying to hide. They're awaiting a secret shipment that's already late - and they have the kind of customers no one can afford to annoy. For as dangerous as the Duncans are, they're right at the bottom of a criminal food chain stretching halfway around the world.\nFor Reacher, it would have made much more sense to keeping on going, to put some distance between himself and the hardcore trouble that's bearing down on him.\nFor Reacher, that was also impossible.\nWORTH DYING FOR is the kind of explosive thriller only Lee Child could write and only Jack Reacher could survive - a heart-racing page-turner no suspense fan will want to miss.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b30e78ab5f8004bdce157b8dcc3b2dee25d75e1b","amp;dn":"Worth+Dying+For+%284296%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b30e78ab5f8004bdce157b8dcc3b2dee25d75e1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,14,120,171,95,128,4,189,206,21,123,141,204,59,45,238,37,215,94,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
