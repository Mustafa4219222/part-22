Also if you use your PC to watch it, installing LAV Filter will help you a lot if you want to use KMPlayer or PotPlayer. However, MPC-HC (preferably in K-Lite Media Codec Pack) is the recommended. Many updated players have native support for the codec. To play on Android, use MX Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2620731bf80b76952f18d99973b9405aa43292d","amp;dn":"DoctorAdventures+Rachel+Starr+ZZ+Hospital+Ri-Dick-Ulous+Behavior","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2620731bf80b76952f18d99973b9405aa43292d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,98,7,49,191,128,183,105,82,241,141,153,151,59,148,5,170,67,41,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
