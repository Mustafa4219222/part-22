Daltrey said, &quot;It turned out we both loved Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates. They'd been a big influence on both our bands. That heavy power-trio sound, backing up a singer; it's a British institution. No-one does that better than us.&quot;\n\nJohnson was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January 2013, but was well enough to press ahead with the collaboration when The Who finished their world tour. Going Back Home was recorded in the space of a week in November 2013. According to Johnson, &quot;Roger jumped up and said, 'Let's do it,'. He knew this lovely little studio called Yellow Fish in Uckfield. Unfortunate name for a place, but a great studio.&quot; The album's tracklisting was revealed on 22 February 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc0c5950dcdb4a8781be677eb404dd63dceff2f","amp;dn":"Wilko+Johnson+%2F+Roger+Daltrey+-+Going+Back+Home+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc0c5950dcdb4a8781be677eb404dd63dceff2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,192,197,149,13,205,180,168,120,27,230,119,235,64,77,214,61,206,255,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
