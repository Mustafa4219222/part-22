The third battle of Ypres, culminating in a desperate struggle for the ridge and little village of Passchendaele, was one of the most appalling campaigns in the First World War. A million Tommies, Canadians and Anzacs assembled at the Ypres Salient in the summer of 1917, mostly raw young troops keen to do their bit for King and Country. Lyn Macdonald's &quot;They Called it Passchendaele&quot; tells their tale of mounting disillusion amid mud, terror and desperate privation, yet it is also a story of immense courage, comradeship, songs, high spirits and bawdy humour. &quot;It is rare to find a history of the First World War which manages to convey the front-line soldiers' experiences and to describe what it was that enabled those who survived to get through it. Lyn Macdonald has done just that&quot;. (&quot;Sunday Times&quot;). Over the past twenty years Lyn Macdonald has established a popular reputation as an author and historian of the First World War. Her books are based on the accounts of eyewitnesses and survivors, told in their own words, and cast a unique light on the First World War. Most are published by Penguin.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/They-Called-Passchendaele-Battle-Fought/dp/0140165096&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/They-Called-Passchendaele-Battle-Fought/dp/0140165096&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b439f56a129503665f87538162f7f2708619fd9c","amp;dn":"They+Called+it+Passchendaele%3A+The+Story+of+the+Battle+of+Ypres+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b439f56a129503665f87538162f7f2708619fd9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,57,245,106,18,149,3,102,95,135,83,129,98,247,242,112,134,25,253,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
