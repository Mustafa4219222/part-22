As the name suggests, it covered the Atari ST\nand Commodore Amiga micros, both for entertainment and serious use. The\nmag only lasted a year before being split into two separate titles, ST\nFormat and Amiga Format, both of which ran for many years afterwards.\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans collected from\nvarious sources. They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and copying\n- this should prove very useful for the archivist who'd like\nto have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most PDF\nreaders, including most capable mobile devices.\n\nCompared to some magazines of the era, Future Publishing's titles were\nrelatively restrained in their use of mad fonts and random blocks of\ncolour, so the OCR accuracy isn't too bad. However, as always, this is a\n&quot;best effort&quot; - don't expect perfection and you won't be disappointed :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or Google RetroPDFs) for more\ninformation.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to\nRetroPDFs for their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, Torch, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine. Nostalgia ain't what it used to be ;)\n\nKen D \n\n(Google 'RetroPDFs')\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ea1ebaf0263646206d7ecdd3581db590ae4f4b0","amp;dn":"ST%2FAmiga+Format+magazine+issues+1-13+complete+OCR%27d+PDFs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ea1ebaf0263646206d7ecdd3581db590ae4f4b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,161,235,175,2,99,100,98,6,215,236,221,53,129,219,89,10,228,244,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
