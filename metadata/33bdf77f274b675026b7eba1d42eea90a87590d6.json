After delivering 2 epic releases with Electronic 80s 1 &amp; 2 and selling over 1 million copies, we now bring you the other side of the 80s. Moving on from the more electro-pop side, this is the cooler, more credible face of the decade that includes forgotten classics, one hit wonders and seminal bands that summed up the culture of that era. This was a decade where the pop stars had personalities as big as their tunes, from the scruffy indie types to the glamorous pop icons - there was something for everyone. Take yourself back with this seminal 3CD Xmas release that features massive hits from iconic artists including David Bowie, Blondie, The Smiths, Kate Bush, The Cure, Culture Club and loads more.
