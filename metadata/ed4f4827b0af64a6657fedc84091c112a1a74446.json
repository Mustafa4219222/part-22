Their style is most easily described as extreme/technical metal with some jazz influence. They use extended polymetric passages, complex drum patterns, angular, dissonant guitar riffs, and harsh vocals. Their lineup has always been consistent, apart from bass which has been handled by many people since the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inception. Their current lineup consists of Jens Kidman (vocals), Fredrik Thordendal (lead/rhythm guitar + backup vocals), MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rten HagstrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶m (rhythm guitar + backup vocals), Dick LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶vgren (bass) and Tomas Haake (drums).\n\nMeshuggah is widely acknowledged as an influence on many modern metal bands from Textures to Tool. They are regarded as pioneers by critics and musicians alike.\n\nDiscography\n\nPsykisk Testbild (EP, 1989)\nContradictions Collapse (1991)\nNone (EP, 1994)\nSelfcaged (1995)\nDestroy Erase Improve (1995)\nThe True Human Design (1997)\nChaosphere (1998)\nContradictions Collapse and None (1999)\nRare Trax (2001)\nNothing (2002)\nI (EP, 2004)\nCatch Thirty-Three (2005)\nNothing (Remix With DVD) (2006)\nobZen (2008)\n\n\nBand history\n\nMeshuggah was formed in UmeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ in 1987; two years later, the band released their first record, an EP entitled Psykisk Testbild (which can be roughly translated as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPsychological test imageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4f4827b0af64a6657fedc84091c112a1a74446","amp;dn":"Meshuggah+-+Obzen+%282008%29+%5BCDRIP+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4f4827b0af64a6657fedc84091c112a1a74446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,79,72,39,176,175,100,166,101,127,237,200,64,145,193,18,161,167,68,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
