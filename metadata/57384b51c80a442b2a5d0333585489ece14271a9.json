The box labeled Hard disk (no sandbox) shows changes by a program running normally. The box labeled Hard disk (with sandbox) shows changes by a program running under Sandboxie. The animation illustrates that Sandboxie is able to intercept the changes and isolate them within a sandbox, depicted as a yellow rectangle. It also illustrates that grouping the changes together makes it easy to delete all of them at once.\n\n\n[b]Benefits of the Isolated Sandbox[/b]\n\n    * Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially. \n\n    * Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows. \n\n    * Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system. \n\n    * Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox. \n\n\nOperating systems: Windows 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 7; 32-bit and 64-bit. \n\nTranslations: The following languages can be selected during installation: English, Albanian, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Czech, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Polish, Portuguese (Brasil), Russian, Spanish and Turkish.\n\nWindows 2000: You may need to install GDIPLUS.DLL if you don't already have it.\n\nWindows 64-bit: Fully supported.
