She's been a regular winner as the best female jazz singer in Japan since 1997 through the reader's poll of Swing Journal, the most known jazz magazine in Japan. Though her attitude towards music is so rigorous and ardent, her caring and heart-warming character grasps the hearts of many enthusiastic fans as well as staff and of musicians. She has also been successful in the Asian and European markets as well, having concerts in Taiwan, Singapore, Korea, and other countries. She does not categorize herself as jazz, and is very eager to dig down from Motown tunes to rock and pop numbers, so tickets sell out fast when she appears in jazz clubs. There's just no comparison to Keiko Lee's soulful voice and virtuosity.\n\nTrack list:\n01. Smile\n02. I Didn't Know What Time It Was\n03. How Do You Keep The Music Playing\n04. The Very Thought Of You\n05. Fever\n06. More Than You Know\n07. Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most\n08. If I Should Lose You\n09. People\n10. When Sunny Gets Blue\n11. You Don't Konw Me\n\nEnjoy and share!
