These days, instead of one mainstream -- muziki wa dansi -- there are three, including the Arabic-sounding taarab and the younger bongo flava that includes singers like Saida Karoli. On Rough Guide to the Music of Tanzania, Karoli performs in a spare, acoustic setting. The disc includes the R&amp;B (with local influence) of Dataz and the hip-hop of X Plastaz. What sticks in the mind for than anything else, however, are the bands like Ottu Jazz Band or the late Ndala Kasheba, whose 12-string guitar powered his band on music influenced by Congolese soukous. The taarab really stands alone, a style utterly apart, and quite beautiful in its ornamentation. Compiler Werner Graebner has included a pair of more traditional tracks, one from the Master Musicians of Tanzania, founded by the late, great Hukwe Zawose.\n\n\n:: track list ::\n01.
