Written by a practicing and successful scientist, it explores why questions arise in science and looks at how questions are tackled, what constitutes a valid answer, and why. The author does not bog the reader down in technical details or lists of facts to memorize. He uses accessible examples, illustrations, and descriptions to address complex issues. The book should prove enlightening to anyone who has been perplexed by the meaning, relevance, and moral or political implications of science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da20c0b0c9402eab495024052b41b8d8e1bbea9","amp;dn":"The+Joy+of+Science%3A+An+Examination+of+How+Scientists+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da20c0b0c9402eab495024052b41b8d8e1bbea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,162,12,11,12,148,2,234,180,149,2,64,82,180,27,141,142,27,190,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
