Developed by MicroProse and Chris Sawyer and published by Hasbro Interactive, the game was released for Microsoft Windows on March 31, 1999 and was later ported to the Xbox game console. Later, a special edition called Roller Coaster Tycoon Deluxe was released which contained the original game and the two expansion packs. It is the first game in the RollerCoaster Tycoon series and was followed by RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 and RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, but RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 was developed without input from the franchise's creator, Chris Sawyer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226e34a32a14bb2c4f930b9ebe31ef47df13f978","amp;dn":"RollerCoaster+Tycoon+Deluxe+---Mahnoodle+TFB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226e34a32a14bb2c4f930b9ebe31ef47df13f978","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,110,52,163,42,20,187,44,79,147,11,158,190,49,239,71,223,19,249,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
