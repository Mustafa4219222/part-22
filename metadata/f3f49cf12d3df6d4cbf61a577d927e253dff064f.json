With pianist Sir Charles Thompson, bassist Gene Ramey and either Mousie Alexander or Gus Johnson on drums, these small-group swing sets are a bit unusual in that, in addition to three standards, there are seven compositions by Clayton and three from Tate, none of which are well-known. The horn players are in good form investigating and swinging this fresh material.
