Here, as all over Europe, they are the most important sources for the study of ancient cultures. Besides the rich and interesting finds, there are stone tombs within these mounds that reveal something of the history of Thracian architecture. These burial mounds have produced jewelry worn by women, arms borne by men, the ornaments of their cuirasses and shields and the trappings of their horses, vessels made of clay, bronze, glass, silver, and gold, and countless other articles used in daily life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac9258ada7b127963729cb31a71d9c970257949a","amp;dn":"Thracian+treasures+from+Bulgaria+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac9258ada7b127963729cb31a71d9c970257949a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,146,88,173,167,177,39,150,55,41,203,49,167,29,156,151,2,87,148,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
