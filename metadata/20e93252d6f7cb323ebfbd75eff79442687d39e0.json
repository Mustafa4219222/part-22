These tools include a world editor with which to create custom \nlandscapes, a shape editor that allows the creation of objects (e.g., trees, \ncars, houses) that can be placed on the landscape, a color editor that allows \ncontrol over the game's palette, a cockpit editor with which to develop the in-\ncockpit graphics, and a model editor with which to develop flight models for \naircraft.\n\nFST includes a fully working, flight simulation game called &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Aside \nfrom being a game that can be played in itself, players can opt to use the tools \nin FST to alter elements of Top Gun into a whole new gaming experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e93252d6f7cb323ebfbd75eff79442687d39e0","amp;dn":"Flight+Sim+Toolkit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e93252d6f7cb323ebfbd75eff79442687d39e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,233,50,82,214,247,203,50,62,191,189,117,239,247,148,66,104,125,57,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
