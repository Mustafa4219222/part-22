For 2000 years, Britain has been a Christian country. Or has it? In fact, our ancestors actually kept many other dark, fantastical beliefs alive. It was a world underpinned by outlandish, dangerous and plain weird beliefs. Ideas that today seem unbelievable, but were seen as uncontroversial and hugely influential, with some having shaped our history as much as mainstream religion.........aka Gods and Monsters\n\n\n\n\n4)  Evil Spirits \nImagine a world full of demons who could enter your body and take control of it. A world populated by invisible spirits that would steal humans - and especially babies, leaving 'changelings' in their place. A world where inappropriate behaviour or mental illness was taken as evidence of possession by a devil, and a sign that your soul was damned to hell. For thousands of years this was the world our ancestors believed they lived in, and it was utterly terrifying. But why did they believe this? What did they think spirits were? And what did they do to try and defend themselves against them? With the aid of dramatic reconstructions Tony tries to answer these questions. \n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/7944/superstitionsscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/7944/superstitionsscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/6599/superstitionsscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/6599/superstitionsscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3210/superstitionsscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3210/superstitionsscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6646/superstitionsscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6646/superstitionsscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3692/superstitionsscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/3692/superstitionsscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3636/superstitionsscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/3636/superstitionsscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5425/superstitionsscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/5425/superstitionsscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4985/superstitionsscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img31.imageshack.us/img31/4985/superstitionsscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/249/superstitionsscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/249/superstitionsscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2037\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 46.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8913709/Tony-Robinson-on-the-top-five-superstitions-that-gripped-medieval-Britain.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8913709/Tony-Robinson-on-the-top-five-superstitions-that-gripped-medieval-Britain.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:986e28b38b8661969ee4c7b80998e8fea8878490","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Tony+Robinsons+Superstitions+4of5+Evil+Spiri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"986e28b38b8661969ee4c7b80998e8fea8878490","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,110,40,179,139,134,97,150,158,228,199,184,9,152,232,254,168,135,132,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
