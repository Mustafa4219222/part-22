The importance and continued popularity of 80s pop is not to be underestimated, and the emergence of serious synthesised music producers in Kraftwerk, The Human League, Heaven 17, The B.E.F., OMD, Yazoo, Ultravox, Talk Talk, Japan, Devo, Sparks, Gary Numan, New Order and The Pet Shop Boys, all of whom massively pushed the boundaries in experimenting with (mainly) Roland synths in this era, ultimately showed the way for the house and techno producers of the 90s to the present day. Within this more serious side there was also some brilliant, pure synth ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ pop from The Thompson Twins, Scritti Politti, Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, Thomas Dolby, Simple Minds, Propaganda, Erasure, China Crisis, Belouis Some, The Lotus Eaters, A Flock Of Seagulls, Howard Jones, Blancmange and The Associates. As with the 2 preceding Anthems releases we have cherry picked a mix of the biggest commercial tracks in addition to the most important and influential ones making it a truly fantastic collectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s package and thoroughly entertaining listen. The TV creative promises to be truly epic, proper hairs on the back of the neck stuff.\n\n\nGenre: Electronic\nArtisti: VA\nQuality: VBR kbps\nTime: 235:27 min\nSize: 343 MB \n\n\n[img]http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/5886/tracklistxy2.gif[/img]\n\n\nCD1\n\n1.
