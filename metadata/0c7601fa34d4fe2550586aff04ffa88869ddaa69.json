She's about to be chased, shot at, sexually harassed, and guilted into going to her unbearable cousin's birthday party, and she doesn't even know why! Well, maybe she knows why she has to go the birthday party (her mom is an expert guilt-tripper), but that doesn't mean she has to put up with all the other stuff!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7601fa34d4fe2550586aff04ffa88869ddaa69","amp;dn":"Steve+Rolston+-+One+Bad+Day","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7601fa34d4fe2550586aff04ffa88869ddaa69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,118,1,250,52,212,254,37,80,88,106,255,4,255,168,136,105,221,170,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
