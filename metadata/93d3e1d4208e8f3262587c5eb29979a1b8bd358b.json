Cranius (a face-and-bulging-brain atop a hand, which perches on a supersurgeon body, Otto) and Janus (an extra head and smaller torso sprout from his back) have seized corporate control of Aberrance U.S.A., a city reservation-cum-theme park for the very differently abled that was founded by the late (sort of, it develops) Damien Kane, whom cancer experimentation made elephant-man-like. The citizenry is restless, and after albino agent Kilcrop comes to investigate the murder of dissident Berthold the Amazing Gill-Boy, all hell breaks loose-and just as Cranius as, atop Otto, Dr. Von Schadel is set to launch his surefire-hit reality show, American Freak. A verbal and visual stream of gross-outs, gunplay, gore, grimaces, un-PC guffaws, and heroics executed with an oh-puh-leez! attitude, this is immense over-the-top fun, perfect for a movie with Jim Carrey as everybody except Niko, the one-armed, two-winged love interest.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acidJ1EN.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acidJ1EN.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abwfxC7F.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/abwfxC7F.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acxGLF5Q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acxGLF5Q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acbTDYmB.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/acbTDYmB.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adhmKlIn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/adhmKlIn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ablLgmL0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgbox.com/ablLgmL0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93d3e1d4208e8f3262587c5eb29979a1b8bd358b","amp;dn":"The+Un-Men+1-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93d3e1d4208e8f3262587c5eb29979a1b8bd358b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,211,225,212,32,142,143,50,98,88,124,94,178,153,121,161,184,189,53,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
