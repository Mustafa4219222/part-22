Addressing this gap,        :\n : Algebraic Curves in Cryptography explores the rich uses of algebraic curves:\n : in a range of cryptographic applications, such as secret sharing,          :\n : frameproof codes, and broadcast encryption.                                :\n :                                                                            :\n : Suitable for researchers and graduate students in mathematics and computer :\n : science, this self-contained book is one of the first to focus on many     :\n : topics in cryptography involving algebraic curves. After supplying the     :\n : necessary background on algebraic curves, the authors discuss              :\n : error-correcting codes, including algebraic geometry codes, and provide an :\n : introduction to elliptic curves. Each chapter in the remainder of the book :\n : deals with a selected topic in cryptography (other than elliptic curve     :\n : cryptography). The topics covered include secret sharing schemes,          :\n : authentication codes, frameproof codes, key distribution schemes, broadcast:\n : encryption, and sequences. Chapters begin with introductory material before:\n : featuring the application of algebraic curves.                             :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7db590fcc70d78c5598e074e5e7c518dd74bb28","amp;dn":"CRC+Press+Algebraic+Curves+in+Cryptography+2013+Retail+eBook-Bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7db590fcc70d78c5598e074e5e7c518dd74bb28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,219,89,15,204,112,215,140,85,152,224,116,229,231,197,24,221,116,187,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
