It's a hip hop track that I made using a wu tang beat. \n\nAt the time I didn't have the greatest gear. I recorded it with a shure SM58 and a 12&quot; Vinyl of Wu Tang - Can it all be so simple. Because it was a 'live' recording (meaning I didn't have a vocal booth) I needed to do the vocals on top of the instrumental at the same time. It took me about 40 takes to get it right. This was made about 13 years ago\n\nI worked at a Huskey Service Station for a year. Huskey is a gas station chain in Canada. Over the course of a year working nightshift I seen enough crazy shit to write a book about it.\n\nAfter the stress of working nightshift from 11PM till 7AM every day I needed to get this out before I snapped. \n\nPlease comment if you enjoyed.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;116279747d757e7f3f7570677875627e7f51767c70787d3f727e7c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aacd321d84f1677f9832c5e830396ee34bf75e9d","amp;dn":"DJ+Shell+Shox+-+Rather+Be+Gaming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aacd321d84f1677f9832c5e830396ee34bf75e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,205,50,29,132,241,103,127,152,50,197,232,48,57,110,227,75,247,94,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
