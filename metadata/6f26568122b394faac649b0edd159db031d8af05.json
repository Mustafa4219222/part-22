While continuing to cover the most fundamental topics in fluid mechanics, this latest work emphasizes advanced analytical approaches to aid in the analytical process and corresponding physical interpretation. It also addresses the need for a more flexible mathematical language (utilizing vector and tensor analysis and transformation theory) to cover the growing complexity of fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nRevised and updated, the text centers on shock-wave structure, shock-wave derivatives, and shock-produced vorticity; supersonic diffusers; thrust and lift from an asymmetric nozzle; and outlines operator methods and laminar boundary-layer theory. In addition, the discussion introduces pertinent assumptions, reasons for studying a particular topic, background discussion, illustrative examples, and numerous end-of-chapter problems.\r\n\r\nUtilizing a wide variety of topics on inviscid and viscous fluid dynamics, the author covers material that includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViscous dissipation\r\n\r\nThe second law of thermodynamics\r\n\r\nCalorically imperfect gas flows\r\n\r\nAerodynamic sweep\r\n\r\nShock-wave interference\r\n\r\nUnsteady one-dimensional flow\r\n\r\nInternal ballistics\r\n\r\nForce and momentum balance\r\n\r\nThe Substitution Principle\r\n\r\nRarefaction shock waves\r\n\r\nA comprehensive treatment of flow property derivatives just downstream of an unsteady three-dimensional shock\r\n\r\nShock-generated vorticity\r\n\r\nTriple points\r\n\r\nAn extended version of the Navierâ€’Stokes equations\r\n\r\nShock-free supersonic diffusers\r\n\r\nLift and thrust from an asymmetric nozzle\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalytical Fluid Dynamics, Third Edition outlines the basics of analytical fluid mechanics while emphasizing analytical approaches to fluid dynamics. Covering the material in-depth, this book provides an authoritative interpretation of formulations and procedures in analytical fluid dynamics, and offers analytical solutions to fluid dynamic problems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f26568122b394faac649b0edd159db031d8af05","amp;dn":"Analytical+Fluid+Dynamics+3rd+ed+-+George+Emanuel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f26568122b394faac649b0edd159db031d8af05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,38,86,129,34,179,148,250,172,100,155,14,221,21,157,176,49,216,175,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
