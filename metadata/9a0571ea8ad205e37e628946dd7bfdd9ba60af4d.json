Yet, they remain as fresh and disturbing today as they were thirteen ars ago. Truly, like all classics, they are timeless and will doubtless live on forever\nFor readers already well acquainted with Arzach, we have decided to make this new compilation of the stories something special, something unique. In addition to telling the story behind his character, Moebius has also created a completely new tale, not yet even seen in France.\nThis story entitled The Legend of Arzach, prowides some insights into the universe of Arzach, and coincidentally, links up with another famous Moebius story in this book, The Detour. The concepts in it were developed by yours truly, jointly with Moebius, for the purpose of selling a feature, or television series, based upon this wonderful character. Hopefully, the fates permitting, the coming years will see even more of the ptero-warrior\nFor good measure, we have also added several more fantasy stories, including The Ballad, one of MoebiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ best, and the favorite of his wife, Claudine.\nThe dream gets better and better.&quot;\n\nEnjoy\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nATTENTION FELLOW PIRATES:\n\nSome *ssholes are performing automated swarm attacks on mine and other users torrents.
