But it's one that Time Team has long championed, and one that has yielded some amazing results. \n\nThis programme revisits some of the programme's greatest hits, from recreating individual objects such as Stone Age axes, Roman pewter bowls, medieval pottery and a Stone Age sword that throws new light on the myth of King Arthur's Excalibur, to building an entire Iron Age house and a Roman machine that lifted water from a deep well. \n\nThe programme also revisits some of Time Team's forays into living history, from finding out what it felt like to be in Dad's Army to surviving 24 hours as a Victorian prisoner, in an attempt to see the past through our ancestors' eyes. \n\nPlus how a huge and - at times - contentious experiment for the programme finally solved the riddle of Seahenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79264f058b602f48458425f926c8f93ada6b5816","amp;dn":"Time.Team.S20E12.Experimental.Archaeology.%28Xvid%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79264f058b602f48458425f926c8f93ada6b5816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,38,79,5,139,96,47,72,69,132,37,249,38,200,249,58,218,107,88,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
