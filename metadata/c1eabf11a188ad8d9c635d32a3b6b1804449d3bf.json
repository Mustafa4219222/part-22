A good deal of this autobiography was written secretly while Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years on Robben Island by South Africa's apartheid regime. Among the book's interesting revelations is Mandela's ambivalence toward his lifetime of devotion to public works. It cost him two marriages and kept him distant from a family life he might otherwise have cherished. Long Walk to Freedom also discloses a strong and generous spirit that refused to be broken under the most trying circumstances--a spirit in which just about everybody can find something to admire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1eabf11a188ad8d9c635d32a3b6b1804449d3bf","amp;dn":"Nelson+Mandela+--+Long+Walk+To+Freedom+--+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1eabf11a188ad8d9c635d32a3b6b1804449d3bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,234,191,17,161,136,173,141,156,99,93,50,163,182,177,128,68,73,211,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
