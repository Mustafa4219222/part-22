It was released in January 2010 as the lead single from the album, What We Want, What We Get.\n\nBarnes wrote the song after the title came to him while he was walking through London, England. He told Country Weekly that &quot;the lyrics just flowed together with the melody&quot; when he wrote it. Barnes also said that he was inspired by his wife, Annie, who supported him &quot;through all the ups and downs of an artist's career.&quot; After releasing it, he said that he received mail from fans who said that the song's message &quot;saved marriages or became a theme for a couple's relationship.&quot;\n\nThe music video was directed by Joey Boukadakis.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a236e01a435885a1e0d26459e534b08489306fb","amp;dn":"Dave+Barnes+-+God+Gave+Me+You++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a236e01a435885a1e0d26459e534b08489306fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,35,110,1,164,53,136,90,30,13,38,69,158,83,75,8,72,147,6,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
