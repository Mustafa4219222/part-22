Nastos &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-whole-tree-gone-r1709234&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/the-whole-tree-gone-r1709234&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMyra Melford's pithy, candid, creative, quiet fire music is best heard in\nconcert, but her studio recordings give you a very good helping of what's she's\ncapable of in a shorter form. The sextet dubbed Be Bread has evolved over a\nhandful of years, mixing and matching instruments and timbres that favor the\nlithe, playful, and at times craggy piano style of Melford. With clarinetist Ben\nGoldberg, trumpeter Cuong Vu, and guitarist Brandon Ross, Melford has set yet\nanother new standard of excellence in the modern progressive world of jazz. It's\nalso admirable that drummer Matt Wilson is on yet another world-class project as\na sideman alongside the still underappreciated acoustic bass guitarist Stomu\nTakeishi. While these compositions comprise, in part, older material, some taken\nfrom the suite &quot;The Whole Place Goes Up,&quot; she continues to massage and morph\nthis music with startling originality and purpose. Goldberg's clarinet -- taking\nover for predecessor Marty Ehrlich -- sports an unforced, simpler feeling like\nthe noble, ebony colored wood it is made from. With the more demonstrative Vu,\nthey come to terms Melford's rambling, bluesy piano with quick unison lines and\nspiky accents on &quot;Moon Bird,&quot; breeze along in the modified tango &quot;Through the\nSame Gate,&quot; or create high drama in combustible modal freedom for the 5/4 beat\nof the title selection. Melford's balanced music is a marvelous combination of\ncomposed and spontaneously improvised approaches, best heard on &quot;A Generation\nComes &amp; Another Goes,&quot; much like a Carla Bley mix of spooky seriousness and\ndancing whimsy. Ross, a far too talented player to continue flying under the\nradar, gets a sweet, plucky feature during &quot;On the Lip Of Insanity,&quot; where the\nband is careful being careful. At times you hear funky or Eastern Indian\ninferences, while overall, the music is not so complicated as it is elegant and\nparabolic. Happily, it is another triumph for Melford in that her hot streak of\nextraordinarily original projects keeps rolling on and upping the ante.\n\n--\n\nby John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35205&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=35205&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Stef\n\nby Kevin Le Gendre &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/qjd3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/qjd3&lt;/a&gt;\n\npor Sergio Piccirilli (es) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/03/20/myra-melfords-be-bread-the-whole-tree-gone/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2010/03/20/myra-melfords-be-bread-the-whole-tree-gone/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f596d223db02b85e6b056891b4a3044c5e718139","amp;dn":"Myra+Melford%5C%27s+Be+Bread+-+The+Whole+Tree+Gone+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f596d223db02b85e6b056891b4a3044c5e718139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,150,210,35,219,2,184,94,107,5,104,145,180,163,4,76,94,113,129,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
