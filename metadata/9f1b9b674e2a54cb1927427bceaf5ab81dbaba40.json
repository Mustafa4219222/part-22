This is an essential read for anyone interested in stealth design and the issues involved in this evolving technology.\n\nThis exciting book explores the full extent of threats to warships and thus the transformational change in naval architecture to incorporate these modern stealth technologies.\nFirst book to give an insight into a growing area of interest - stealth warship technology - which is crucial for future developments in warship construction. It demonstrates the importance of materials used in warship construction and how this influences all of a naval platform's design parameters.\nStealth technology is now considered a critical component within warship design, with interest in the concept of stealth increasing around the globe as naval forces adapt to new challenges. Many new developing nations are now implementing their first generation of stealth technology military hardware.\n\ntitle link:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f1b9b674e2a54cb1927427bceaf5ab81dbaba40","amp;dn":"Stealth+Warship+Technology+%28Reeds+Marine+Engineering+and+Technol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f1b9b674e2a54cb1927427bceaf5ab81dbaba40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,27,155,103,78,42,84,203,25,39,66,123,206,175,90,184,29,186,186,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
