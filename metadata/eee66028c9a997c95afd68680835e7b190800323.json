A card is chosen. In this case, it's the Six of Diamonds. The Four of Diamonds  #   is also used. You clearly place the Six of Diamonds  #   in the spectator's closed hands  in a sandwich manner , holding on to the Four of Diamonds.\n\nAs you slowly shake the Four, the pips -- that is, the diamonds -- are seen to visually multiply and move across the card to form the Six of Diamonds. The spectator opens their hands to find the Four of Diamonds, and all is handed out for complete examination.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee66028c9a997c95afd68680835e7b190800323","amp;dn":"%28Card+Magic%29+Wayne+Hauchin-Distortion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee66028c9a997c95afd68680835e7b190800323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,230,96,40,201,169,151,201,90,253,104,104,8,53,231,177,144,128,3,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
