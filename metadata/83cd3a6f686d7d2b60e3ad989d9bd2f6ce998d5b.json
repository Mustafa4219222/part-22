He's sent a transporter where he puts the eggs - unfortunately the transporter takes him with it and then gets lost in space. After 53 deep-frozen years, he's found by a private wreckage collector team under the unscrupulous Rick. On behalf of the mighty company Terracor they bring him to an empty space station - but Rick is curious and opens the box... so Charlie has work again, to keep the Critters from eating everybody. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83cd3a6f686d7d2b60e3ad989d9bd2f6ce998d5b","amp;dn":"Critters+4+1992.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83cd3a6f686d7d2b60e3ad989d9bd2f6ce998d5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,205,58,111,104,109,125,43,96,227,173,152,157,155,210,246,206,153,141,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
