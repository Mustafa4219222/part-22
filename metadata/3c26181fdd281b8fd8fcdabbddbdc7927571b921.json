The normally tight-lipped Hooker proves that he could sing on this romping version of &quot;Swear to Tell the Truth,&quot; while A.C. Reed, Little Tommy, Frank Clark, and Muddy Waters, Jr. help out behind the mike elsewhere. A pair of live cuts from 1968 find Hooker stretching out in amazing fashion. ~~ by Bill Dahl.\n\nTracklist\n\n1. Swear To Tell The Truth - 2:06\n2. You Took All My Love - 3:40\n3.
