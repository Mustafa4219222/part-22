The combination of sheer brutality and technical insanity took Emeth to the elite level in the deathmetal scene. This resulted in tours throughout the US, Canada, Israel and Europe. LotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of festivals where destroyed and great venues ripped apart.\n\nDue to several line up problems, Emeth disappeared of the grid for a while, leaving their fans in discontempt.\nFounder MatÃƒÂ­as Dupont (ex Aborted, ex Agathocles) never stopped writing and in search for the perfect musicians he wrote the most brutal and sickest deathmetal to set foot on Belgian soil.\n\nIn order to transcend Telesis, Emeth has worked their asses off to record the most intence, brutal extremity the band has ever produced. With itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own unique style and the perfect mixture of brutality and technical overture, the machine that is called Emeth is about to run you over as Ã¢â‚¬Å“AethyrÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will see daylight soon.\n\nWith vocalist Boris Ã¢â‚¬Å“el BastardoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Cornelissen (ex Leng TchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢e) as their latest aquisition the band is ready to take over the extreme deathmetal scene. The question is nowÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Are you???\n\n\n\nReview:\n\n\nQuote:\nBrainy and intricate technical death metal that could very well be from outer space. That more or less describes the strange oftentimes twisted beauty of the new record from Emeth, Aethyr. The pinnacle of squirrelly tech death these songs still have an undeniable sense of groove to them and seem to rush forward with the rage of a boar. Precise and incredibly intricate, Aethyr is not a record that is going to easily disappoint. There are a lot of very exciting ideas going down on this album, and unveiling them all is quite the musical journey.\n\nRight away, the angular riffing that defines this record is apparent. On top of that, you have the mile a minute growls which are delivered with an Altars of Madness level of insanity. The trippy guitar lines and hyper technical breaks are a lot of fun to listen too. Sure they might not be the easiest thing to latch on too, but they provide a welcome relief from the crushing attack of some of these riffs. The Cattle Decapitation influence is clear, and on songs like the self titled track Aethyr you can feel the razors edge of these riffs digging its way into your flesh. This is what true death metal is about, unholy skull crunching insanity.\n\nAs the grooves tattoo their way into your head, its hard not to love this album. Sure, it doesn't break a whole lot of new ground, but by god is it a strong record. The melodic content is top notch and the songs are all the perfect length. The occasional uses of sampling doesn't sound overdone and the pinch harmonics add a grim flavor to the entire affair. So prepare yourself for the drubbing of a life time, Aethyr is opening up the pit, and if you're not right in the middle of it getting down and dirty you might as well leave the hall.\n\nLine-up:\n\nVocals: Boris &quot;el Bastardo&quot; Cornelissen\nGuitars: MatÃƒÂ­as Dupont\nGuitars: Alan Rawson\nDrums: Nico Veroeven\nBass: Pat de Jonge\n\n\nEmeth - Aethyr (2014)\n\n\n\n\nCBR @ 320kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
