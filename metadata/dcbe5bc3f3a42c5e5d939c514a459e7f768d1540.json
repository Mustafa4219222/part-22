A good, virgin, serial needed though, like\n\nVNX1-IBYH-E5K1-7G8F (thanks Chileanpilot !! ) for a clean JeppView installation\n\nbefore the operation !\n\n\nSo upon inserting original CD2 (with normal setup.inx, NOT CRACKED ) setup\n\nwill not come up with errors, freezes and the like. For FliteStar you only\n\nneed CD1 v8.5 preferably and serial MCW1-11PV-KMFA-8SA8.\n\n\nI have included here a readme file and 6 JPGs from the process.\n\nEnjoy !!!\n\n\nFSallATP\n\n\nUPDATE 08 Jan 2010  ---------  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nmost of your questions are already answered in this or similar posts (try search with jepp*) in this site.\nthe new info is cause Jeppesen has upgraded security, for new installation, change first your computer clock to 31-12-2008 and use cycle 01 of 2009 so the R00D-KCAB can be validated without problems (validation code through phone) then run the program so it will alter the registry settings. Then close the program, change time and reboot. Now you can use any of the recent codes, 25 or 26 of 2009, 01 of 2010 etc. without problems ! \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcbe5bc3f3a42c5e5d939c514a459e7f768d1540","amp;dn":"JEPPESEN+Jeppview3+to+Flitestar+NavData+CD2+conversion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcbe5bc3f3a42c5e5d939c514a459e7f768d1540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,190,91,195,243,164,44,94,93,147,156,81,74,69,158,127,118,141,21,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
