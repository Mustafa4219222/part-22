The kind of love that captures the soul and never dies. That is, until HaydenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father swindled NadineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family, and they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see each other for thirteen years. When his father suddenly dies, Hayden returns home to the familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lakeside mansion Ã¢â‚¬â€ and to his first love. But Nadine and her two young sons arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite ready to trust again. Soon Hayden is left trying to work through mistrust and misinformation to gain the love of the girl no amount of money could make him forgetÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. HEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢S MY SOLDIER BOY Dark, sexy and dangerous, young Ben Powell could steal kisses as deep and stormy as Whitefire Lake. But when he cruelly accused Carlie Surrett of unthinkable sins, he left her in the dust of her shattered dreams. Now, steelier than ever after his stint in the army, Ben is back Ã¢â‚¬â€ making Carlie curse the love that all but destroyed herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and the volcanic passion that still sears her soul.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
