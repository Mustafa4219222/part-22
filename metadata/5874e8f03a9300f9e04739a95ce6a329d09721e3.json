His love for the folk music of the British Isles led him to the Victoria Music Conservatory in the late '70s to study classical guitar. He has performed with a myriad of both Celtic and worldbeat groups, and has released numerous collections of Christmas and Celtic music of his own. ~ James Christopher Monger, All Music Guide\n\nUPLOADERÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S NOTE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ A poster to the comments on my various Celtic music uploads brought this torrent to my attention (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5193917/Celtic_guitar), but the entire thing was titled in Russian, had no information, and had no seeders. This is the same torrent, but I have fixed the tags, and hopefully will get more seeds. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5874e8f03a9300f9e04739a95ce6a329d09721e3","amp;dn":"Greg+Joy+-+Celtic+Secrets+II+%28Acoustic+Guitar%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5874e8f03a9300f9e04739a95ce6a329d09721e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,116,232,240,58,147,0,249,224,71,57,169,92,230,163,41,208,151,33,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
