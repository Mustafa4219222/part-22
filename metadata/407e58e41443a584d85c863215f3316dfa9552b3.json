Unlike many directors, Scott has been remarkably transparent about his craft, offering the audience glimpses into his creative process. This book explores Scott's oeuvre in depth, devoting a chapter to his 22 primary works, from his first effort, Boy and Bicycle (1962), through Robin Hood (2010). Topics discussed include the critical reception of the films, and the ways in which Scott's works function as cinematic mediators on issues such as religion, women's rights and history.\n\nPublisher: McFarland (August 7, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0786458666\nISBN-13: 978-0786458660","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:407e58e41443a584d85c863215f3316dfa9552b3","amp;dn":"Ridley+Scott+A+Critical+Filmography%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"407e58e41443a584d85c863215f3316dfa9552b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,126,88,228,20,67,165,132,216,92,134,50,21,243,49,109,250,149,82,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
