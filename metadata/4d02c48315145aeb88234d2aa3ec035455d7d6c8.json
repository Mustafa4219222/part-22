The country is now governed by the New Founding Fathers of America, who have sanctioned an annual 12-hour period called The Purge, during which all crime, including murder, becomes legal. The opening credits display a variety of surveillance camera footage depicting acts of violence occurring in numerous towns and cities across the United States during The Purge.\n\nJames Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is a wealthy salesman who has made a fortune selling home security systems that are specifically designed for The Purge. One of the neighbors, Grace, tells James' wife Mary (Lena Headey) the neighbors have been gossiping that the extension on the Sandins' house was financed by the security systems James sold them. At their heavily-fortified house, Mary struggles with their two children, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder); Zoey is dating an older boy named Henry (Tony Oller) whom Zoey's father doesn't approve of, and Charlie questions the need for The Purge. When James arrives home, he explains to the family how The Purge acts as a catharsis for the American people, giving them a chance to release their pent-up aggression and other negative emotions how they see fit.\n\nAfter dinner, Charlie fixes a remote controlled robot he uses to view and film events around the house. The family gathers in the lounge, where James initiates the lockdown, shielding all the doors and windows of the house. An official Emergency Broadcast System message appears on television, which explains the rules of The Purge and that all emergency services will be suspended during the 12-hour period. Sirens begin blaring outside, announcing the commencement of the Purge. Zoey asks to be excused to her bedroom, where she finds Henry, who sneaked into the house before the lockdown. Henry explains to Zoey he wants to convince James to bless their relationship and figured he could not be thrown out of the house during The Purge.\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d02c48315145aeb88234d2aa3ec035455d7d6c8","amp;dn":"The+Purge+MP4CAM.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d02c48315145aeb88234d2aa3ec035455d7d6c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,2,196,131,21,20,90,235,136,35,77,42,163,236,3,84,85,215,214,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
