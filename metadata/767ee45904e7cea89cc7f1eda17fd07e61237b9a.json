I've got really crap upload (5kbps..) so if you grab this from me please be patient, and please do seed it to help me out.\n\nInfo from: http://www.blackvoxel.com/view.php?node=1239\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThe story take place in the future. Tired of the civilisation, you decided to retire to a distant world. You bought a new discovered planet in your local planet selling agency.\n\nThe dealer made a good price on a paradisiac planet with beautiful landscape with islands, sandy beaches, palm forest and a beautiful blue sky. The catalog showed a friendly world populated of peacefull animals.\n\nYou take your new ship and go through the long journey. During the trip, you dreamed of your new world. And finaly, after a year of boring travell you reached the orbit and started the landing procedure.\n\nInfortunately, you hit an asteroid that was not on the map and your ship was heavily damaged. The ship wasn't controllable anymore and finally you crashed on your planet.\n\nBy chance, you still alive, but most of your equipment and materials was destroyed.\n\nAs soon as you looked around you, your realized that the planet wasn't what the dealer promised to you.\n\nWhat a strange and desolated world with a black sky and strange luminous blocks !!!\n\nAll what you see is uncommon and you know nothing about it...\n\nAs you look on your personal digital assistant, you noticed you received an important email that arrived using powerfull long distance intergalactic emitters : the agency said that they may have made a mistake because someone confused planet data files. They said that in the eventuality you remain alive, the sales contract did not mention the details of the surface of the planet, and infortunately, they can't made any exchange and refund.\n\nBut before you can do something, you have no choice : you have no intergalactic ship to escape and no suitable communication equipment to query some help.\n\nWhat you will do now is up to you...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nThis should include both 32/64 versions for the game.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:767ee45904e7cea89cc7f1eda17fd07e61237b9a","amp;dn":"BlackVoxel+1.21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"767ee45904e7cea89cc7f1eda17fd07e61237b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,126,228,89,4,231,206,168,156,199,241,237,161,127,208,126,97,35,123,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
