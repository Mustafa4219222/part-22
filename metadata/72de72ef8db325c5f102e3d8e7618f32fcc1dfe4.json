What other president has written forty books,     :\n : hunted lions, founded a third political party, survived an assassin's      :\n : bullet, and explored an unknown river longer than the Rhine? Packed with   :\n : more adventure, variety, drama, humor, and tragedy than a big novel, yet   :\n : documented down to the smallest fact, this masterwork recounts the last    :\n : decade of perhaps the most amazing life in American history.               :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72de72ef8db325c5f102e3d8e7618f32fcc1dfe4","amp;dn":"Edmund+Morris+Colonel+Roosevelt+2010+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72de72ef8db325c5f102e3d8e7618f32fcc1dfe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,222,114,239,141,179,37,197,241,2,227,216,231,97,143,50,252,193,223,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
