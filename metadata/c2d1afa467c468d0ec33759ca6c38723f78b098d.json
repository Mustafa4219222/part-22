The fact  we  released  our  proper\n release 41 days after your crack simply has to do with the  fact  that  our\n members have a real life too and don't spend all their  time  playing  each\n and every game pred the day or week  they  are  out.  We  did  notice  your\n pathetic crack a few weeks afterwards when one of our  members  decided  to\n try the game, using your release. The entire proper crack for this  release\n was done in about two days and then thoroughly tested for  two  more.  Your\n reaction it is not suitable to release a proper after such a long  time  is\n understandable but nevertheless it doesn't change  the  fact  your  release\n screamed for a &quot;crapfix&quot;, old doesn't mean forgotten!\n\n Next, you mix up a fact that a loader  is  technically  the  same  like  an\n emulation and try to claim everybody is only releasing unclean cracks. What\n was it about the evolution ladder guys? It  seems  your  lab  monkeys  have\n taken over the entire leadership of the group since the real  SKIDROW  died\n in 1993. This can be the only reason you have come to the conclusion that a\n modified startup flow  is  the  same  like  the  immitated  behavior  of  a\n protection, like an EMU does it.\n\n So say what you want, you can talk all day but the simple fact remains, you\n made a pathetic excuse for a xlive crack that would make any true  reverser\n feel sick to his stomach. You then try to change the subject and move focus\n (understandable as this must be embarrassing for you)  to Steam CEG cracks.\n All those who are interested in the next generation of your famous work can\n examine Hitman Absolution, here you really teach the whole scene about  the\n art of reversing by releasing an unmodifed protected exe (if you need proof\n check  the  authenticode  signature  of   the   exe,   signed   by   valve)\n which is nothing but a 100% Authentic loader solution.\n\n We thought since you love the Sims series so much, here  is  another  addon\n also for you guys. Enjoy!\n\n\n Game information:\n =================\n\n Give your Sims the hottest looks and coolest  d cor  from  yesteryear  with\n The Sims 3 70s, 80s, &amp; 90s Stuff.\n\n Sport a 70s disco look with a wide collared jacket and bellbottom pants, go\n 80s glam with shoulder pads and bangle earrings,  or  throw  on  a  rumpled\n flannel shirt for a wild 90s grunge look.
