It is one of their best-known songs. It reached #7 on the Billboard 100, and was later named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&amp;#039;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Beastie Boys also included the track on their hits album, The Sounds of Science, in 1999.\n\nThe video seems to have been a parody of Quiet Riot&amp;#039;s video for &quot;Party All Night&quot; (another of the party songs which the song mocks). Both videos feature overtly geeky characters whose house is then overrun by a multitude of partying people including the respective band.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd57a7ef86dea5fb1b0236bae03167fb9179bc2c","amp;dn":"Beastie+Boys-%28You+Gotta%29+Fight+For+Your+Right+%28To+Party%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd57a7ef86dea5fb1b0236bae03167fb9179bc2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,87,167,239,134,222,165,251,27,2,54,186,224,49,103,251,145,121,188,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
