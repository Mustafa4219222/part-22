CSS decrypting software \n(such as DVD Decrypter, AnyDVD, Smartripper, and DVD Shrink) allows a region-specific DVD to be copied as an all-region DVD. \nIt also removes Macrovision, Content Scrambling System (CSS), region codes, and user operation prohibition.\n\nLegality\nAs DVD Decrypter facilitates the removal of copy restrictions, certain uses may be illegal \nunder the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In countries without similar laws \nthere may not be any legal restrictions.\n\nOn June 6, 2005, the developer (known as &quot;Lightning UK!&quot;) announced [1] via the CD Freaks[2] \nwebsite that he received a cease and desist letter from Macrovision[3]. He later stated it was \nwithin his best interests to comply with the letter, and stopped development of the program. \nBy June 7, 2005 a mirror site was up [4], which allowed people to download the final version (3.5.4.0). \nOn 27 November 2005, Afterdawn.com, a Finnish website, announced that it complied with a letter \nreceived from Macrovision demanding that DVD Decrypter be taken down from its site. Shortly after, \na site with no connection to Lightning UK! appeared and claimed to be the &quot;new&quot; DVD Decrypter Site. \nThis site has since closed down.\n\nMany American legal experts believe that under United States' Federal law, making a backup copy of a\n DVD-Video or an audio CD by a consumer is legal. Some feel this provision of United States law conflicts \nwith the Digital Millennium Copyright Act prohibition of so-called &quot;circumvention measures&quot; of copy protections.\n\nIn 2006, the United States Library of Congress created an exemption that explicitly allows circumventing \naccess control for certain educational purposes.[5]\n\nIn the noted &quot;321&quot; case, Federal District Judge Susan Illston, of the Northern District of California [6], \nruled that the backup copies made with software such as DVD Decrypter are in fact legal but that distribution \nof the software used to make them is illegal. As of the date of this revision, neither the US Supreme Court nor \nthe US Congress has taken definitive action on the matter.\n\nOn October 4, 2005, Lightning UK! continued the development of the burning engine used by DVD Decrypter \nin his new tool, ImgBurn.[7]\n\n// Bakjoo","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de768499d5749f87ef1fafea8cf61b49aee1198d","amp;dn":"dvddecrypter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de768499d5749f87ef1fafea8cf61b49aee1198d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,118,132,153,213,116,159,135,239,31,175,234,140,246,27,73,174,225,25,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
