Clapton is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of The Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time.[1] Clapton ranked second in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;[2] and fourth in Gibson's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.[3]\n\nIn the mid 1960s, Clapton departed from the Yardbirds to play blues with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. In his one-year stay with Mayall, Clapton gained the nickname &quot;Slowhand&quot;. Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed Cream, a power trio with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and &quot;arty, blues-based psychedelic pop.&quot; For most of the 1970s, Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of J.J. Cale and the reggae of Bob Marley. His version of Marley's &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; helped reggae reach a mass market.[4] Two of his most popular recordings were &quot;Layla&quot;, recorded by Derek and the Dominos, another band he formed and Robert Johnson's &quot;Crossroads&quot;, recorded by Cream. A recipient of seventeen Grammy Awards,[5] in 2004 Clapton was awarded a CBE at Buckingham Palace for services to music.[6] In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for recovering substance abusers. \n\n\nClapton 2010\n\n\nClapton is the 20th studio album by English rock guitarist and singer-songwriter Eric Clapton. It was released on 27 September 2010 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States.[1][2] The album is Clapton's first studio album in four years following his duet with J.J.Cale in The Road to Escondido (2006), and is made up of a mix of new material and cover songs. Clapton has played tracks off this album such as &quot;Rocking Chair&quot; and &quot;When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful&quot; live on tour.[citation needed] Clapton has said, &quot;This album wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t what it was intended to be at all. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually better than it was meant to be because, in a way, I just let it happen.&quot;[1]\n\nClapton debuted at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, his highest charting album on the chart since Reptile from 2001. In the United States it entered the Billboard 200 at number six, selling 47,000 copies in its first week on the chart.[3] The album reached top five positions in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t &quot;Travelin' Alone&quot; (Lil' Son Jackson) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:56\n2.\t&quot;Rocking Chair&quot; (Hoagy Carmichael) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:04\n3.\t&quot;River Runs Deep&quot; (J.J.
