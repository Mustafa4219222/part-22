But where did Japanese animation come from, and what does it all mean? Written for fans, culture watchers, and perplexed outsiders, this is an engaging tour of the anime megaverse, from older arts and manga traditions to the works of modern directors like Miyazaki and Otomo. Read about anime standbys like giant robots, samurai, furry beasts, high school heroines, and gay/girl/fanboy loveÃ¢â‚¬â€even war and reincarnation, plus all of animeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s major themes, styles, and conventions. At the end of the book are essays on 15 of fandomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite anime, including Evangelion, Esca-flowne, Sailor Moon, and Patlabor. &quot;A good resource and guide to the foundation, historical development and overall themes in Japanese animation and serves as an excellent reference source whether you are an established fan or a person who wants to learn about the cultural aspects of this specific and increasingly popular genre. It is an easy yet thorough read on the myriad of societal aspects and cultural references Japanese animation holds.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e01f1870aa2fd5c69a24e7409ebd4fb011fde9f","amp;dn":"Anime+Explosion+-+Patrick+Drazen.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e01f1870aa2fd5c69a24e7409ebd4fb011fde9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,1,241,135,10,162,253,92,105,162,78,116,9,235,212,251,1,31,222,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
