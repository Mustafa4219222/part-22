On September \n19, 1981 the folk-rock duo reunited for a free concert on the Great Lawn of New \nYork's Central Park attended by more than 500,000 people. They released a live \nalbum from the concert the following March (Warner Brothers LP 2BSK 3654; CD \n3654). It was arranged by Paul Simon and Dave Grusin, and produced by Paul \nSimon, Art Garfunkel, Phil Ramone and Roy Halee.\n\nA video of the concert was also released. The video contains two songs that were \nomitted from the live album: &quot;The Late Great Johnny Ace&quot; and &quot;Late in the \nEvening (Reprise)&quot;. The song about Johnny Ace had been disrupted by a fan \nrushing the stage. Both of these songs appear in the DVD release. The Late Great \nJohnny Ace is not listed in the track listing but appears between A Heart in New \nYork and Kodachrome.\n\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                                 MRS. ROBINSON\n*******************************************************************************\n\nIn the film The Graduate, listless recent college graduate Benjamin Braddock \n(Dustin Hoffman) has an affair with an older married woman, Mrs. Robinson (Anne \nBancroft). The song was not completed for the film; only snippets are heard as \nincidental music. When the film and the music became popular, Paul Simon put the \nsnippets together into a complete song.\n\nAccording to a Variety article by Peter Bart in the May 15th, 2005 issue, \ndirector Mike Nichols had become obsessed with Simon &amp; Garfunkel's music while \nshooting the film. Larry Turman, his producer, made a deal for Simon to write \nthree new songs for the movie. By the time they were nearly finished editing the \nfilm, Simon had only written one new song. Nichols begged him for more but \nSimon, who was touring constantly, told him he didn't have the time. He did play \nhim a few notes of a new song he had been working on; &quot;It's not for the movie... \nit's a song about times past ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ about Mrs. Roosevelt and Joe DiMaggio and stuff.&quot; \nNichols advised Simon, &quot;It's now about Mrs. Robinson, not Mrs. Roosevelt.&quot;\n\n    &quot;Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?\n    Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you.\n    What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?\n    Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.&quot;\n\nare perhaps the most memorable. Paul Simon, a fan of Mickey Mantle, was asked on \nThe Dick Cavett Show by Mantle why Mantle wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t mentioned in the song instead \nof DiMaggio. Simon replied, &quot;It's about syllables, Dick. It's about how many \nbeats there are.&quot;\n\nFor himself, DiMaggio initially complained that he hadn't gone anywhere, but \nsoon dropped his complaints when he realized that he gained new fame with baby \nboomers because of the song.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed in March 1999, shortly after DiMaggio's death, Simon \nexplained that the line was meant as a sincere tribute to DiMaggio's \nunpretentious heroic stature, in a time when popular culture magnifies and \ndistorts how we perceive our heroes. He further reflected: &quot;In these days of \nPresidential transgressions and apologies and prime-time interviews about \nprivate sexual matters, we grieve for Joe DiMaggio and mourn the loss of his \ngrace and dignity, his fierce sense of privacy, his fidelity to the memory of \nhis wife and the power of his silence.&quot; Simon subsequently performed Mrs. \nRobinson at Yankee Stadium in DiMaggio's honor in April of the same year.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                                HOMEWARD BOUND\n*******************************************************************************\n\n&quot;Homeward Bound&quot; is a 1966 song by Simon and Garfunkel, produced by Bob Johnston \nand recorded on December 14, 1965. Paul Simon wrote the song at Widnes railway \nstation while waiting for his train. The song describes his longing to return \nhome, both to his then girlfriend, Kathy Chitty in Brentwood, Essex, England, \nand to return to the United States. The song debuted on Billboard Hot 100 Chart \non February 12, 1966, peaking at #5. It remained on the charts for 12 weeks.\n\nA live version of the song takes the place of the studio version on the \ncompilation Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest Hits.\n\nThe song is one of Simon's signature tunes along with The Sound of Silence, Mrs. \nRobinson, and Bridge Over Troubled Water and is played frequently at his \nconcerts.\n\nIn 1976, Simon and former Beatle George Harrison played this song and Harrison's \n&quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; on an episode of Saturday Night Live that Simon hosted and \non which Harrison was the musical guest.\n\nSeveral artists have covered this song, including the Beau Brummels, Cher, Janie \nFricke, Jack's Mannequin, William Joseph and Petula Clark.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                                    AMERICA\n*******************************************************************************\n\n&quot;America&quot;, written by Paul Simon, was originally by 1960s folk-rock duo Simon \nand Garfunkel, of which he was a member. It was included in their album \nBookends, released on 3 April 1968.\n\nThe song was released as a single in 1972, to coincide with the album Simon and \nGarfunkel's Greatest Hits, and eventually hit #97 on the Billboard Hot 100. The \nflip side of the single, &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her,&quot; surprisingly did \nslightly better, reaching #53.\n\nThe song describes in first-hand terms with non-rhyming lyrics, the physical and \nmetaphorical journey of two companions in search of the true meaning of America. \nTheir initial hopefulness, indicated by such lyrics as &quot;Let us be lovers,&quot; turns \nto a sense of frustration and sadness, accompanied by the breakdown of their \nrelationship. &quot;'Kathy, I'm lost,' I said, though I knew she was sleeping&quot; is a \nreference to Kathy Chitty, with whom Simon had had a relationship while living \nin England in 1965.\n\nThe song mentions the cities of Saginaw, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; \nthe New Jersey Turnpike; and Mrs. Wagner's Pies.\n\nIn 2000, &quot;America&quot; was featured in the soundtrack to the film Almost Famous. The \nmain character's sister, Anita, uses this song to represent her reason for \nleaving home to become a stewardess.\n\nSubsequent compilation CDs contain a clean intro to &quot;America&quot; as opposed to the \nsegued version on &quot;Bookends&quot;.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                       ME AND JULIO DOWN THE SCHOOLYARD\n*******************************************************************************\n\nIt is about a boy who has broken a law, although the exact law that has been \nbroken is not stated in the song and has become a matter of some debate. When \nhis mother finds out that he has broken the law, she goes to the police station \nto report the crime. He is later arrested, but released when a radical priest \nintervenes. The protagonist of the song had to say goodbye to &quot;Rosie, the Queen \nof Corona&quot;, so the events of the song are most likely to have taken place in \nCorona, Queens. Julio is presumed to be the boy's partner in crime, yet others \nhave suggested that he may also be the person that the singer may engage in a \nfight with. This is a common motif and setting: fights amongst adolescents.\n\nSome believe the incident in the song refers to an arrest at an antiwar protest \non a college campus (the &quot;schoolyard&quot;), with the &quot;radical priest&quot; (whom the \nsinger claims will appear with him &quot;on the cover of Newsweek&quot;) being either \nPhilip or Daniel Berrigan, priests noteworthy for their antiwar activity during \nthe Vietnam War. It has been said also that the &quot;radical priest&quot; could be the \nRev. William Sloane Coffin, chaplain from Yale, upon whom the Scot Sloan \ncharacter in Doonesbury was based.\n\nIn a July 20, 1972 interview for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau asked: &quot;What is it \nthat the mama saw? The whole world wants to know.&quot; Simon replied &quot;I have no idea \nwhat it is... Something sexual is what I imagine, but when I say 'something', I \nnever bothered to figure out what it was. Didn't make any difference to me.&quot; \nThis has not stopped speculation: Truman Capote said that he believed the \nprotagonist and Julio were involved in a homosexual relationship; other \ncommentators have detected references to recreational drug use, and believe that \nthe mother saw the boy buying drugs\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                               SCARBOROUGH FAIR\n*******************************************************************************\n\nThe arrangement made famous by Simon &amp; Garfunkel's &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; \noriginated in the late 20th century. Paul Simon learned it in 1965 in London \nfrom Martin Carthy and Art Garfunkel set it in counterpoint with Canticle, a \nreworking of Simon's 1963 song &quot;The Side of a Hill&quot; with new, anti-war lyrics \n(this was how Garfunkel claimed any authorship). It was the lead track of the \n1966 album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme, and was released as a single after \nbeing featured on the soundtrack to The Graduate in 1968. The copyright credited \nonly Simon and Garfunkel as the authors, causing ill-feeling on the part of \nCarthy, who felt the &quot;traditional&quot; source should have been credited. This rift \nremained until Simon invited Carthy to duet the song with him at a London \nconcert in 2000.\n\nPrior to Simon's learning the song, Bob Dylan had borrowed the melody and \nseveral lines from Carthy's arrangement in creating his song, &quot;Girl from the \nNorth Country,&quot; which appeared on The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963), Nashville \nSkyline (1969), Real Live (1984) and Bob Dylan: The 30th Anniversary Concert \nCelebration (1993).Meaning of the refrain\n\nMuch thought has gone into attempts to explain the refrain &quot;parsley, sage, \nrosemary and thyme&quot;, although, as this is found only in relatively recent \nversions, there may not be much to explain. The oldest versions of &quot;The Elfin \nKnight&quot; (circa 1650) contain the refrain &quot;my plaid away, my plaid away, the wind \nshall not blow my plaid away&quot; (or variations thereof), which may reflect the \noriginal emphasis on the lady's chastity. Slightly younger versions often \ncontain one of a group of related refrains:\n\n    * Sober and grave grows merry in time\n    * Every rose grows merry with time\n    * There's never a rose grows fairer with time\n\nThese are usually paired with &quot;Once she was a true love of mine&quot; or some \nvariant. &quot;Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme&quot; may simply be an alternate rhyming \nrefrain to the original. Folksong scholar MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rta Ramsten states that folksong \nrefrains containing enumerations of herbs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ spices and medical herbs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ occur in \nmany languages, including Swedish, Danish, German, and English.\n\nOther proposed explanations\n\nOn the other hand, elaborate theories have been proposed concerning the possible \nsymbolism of these herbs, some of which are outlined below. When evaluating \nthese theories it should be borne in mind that the earliest extant versions of \nthe original The Elfin Knight ballad date to some 100-150 years after the end of \nthe Medieval period, and the earliest version known to bear the &quot;parsley, sage, \nrosemary and thyme&quot; refrain is from the very late 18th century; thus any \n&quot;medieval&quot; symbolism would most likely have to have been introduced by later \nsingers rather than being preserved continuously since the Middle Ages.\n\nIn &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; the herbs may be a veiled message for the girl where the \nman is explaining why she should come back to him (if she overcomes the five \nimpossible tasks):\n\n    * Parsley:I want you to bear my children\n    * Sage:I'm dependable\n    * Rosemary:Remember me\n    * Thyme:I'm yours\n\nParsley, used to this day as a digestive aid, was said to take away the \nbitterness, and medieval doctors took this in a spiritual sense as well. Sage \nhas been known to symbolize strength for thousands of years. Rosemary represents \nfaithfulness, love and remembrance, and the custom of a bride wearing twigs of \nrosemary in her hair is still practiced in England and several other European \ncountries today. Thyme symbolizes courage, and during the medieval era, knights \nwould often wear images of thyme on their shields when they went to combat. The \nspeaker in the song, by mentioning these four herbs, wishes his true love \nmildness to soothe the bitterness that is between them, strength to stand firm \nin the time of their being apart from each other, faithfulness to stay with him \nduring this period of loneliness and, paradoxically, courage to fulfill her \nimpossible tasks and to come back to him by the time she can.\n\nAlso, parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme are possibly the ingredients of a love \nspell from the Middle Ages, even though the refrain did not exist in the \nmedieval version of the song.\n\nAnother theory considers the possible magical significance of the herbs. \nParsley, sage, rosemary and thyme have allegedly all been closely associated \nwith death and used as charms against the evil eye. In The Elfin Knight (of \nwhich Scarborough Fair is a version), an elf sets impossible tasks to a maid, \nand her replies determine whether she will fall into his clutches or not. \nFrancis Child suggested that the elf was an interloper from another ballad, Lady \nIsabel and the Elf-Knight, and that he should rightly be a mortal man, but as \nAnn Gilchrist points out, &quot;why the use of the herb refrain except as an \nindication of something more than mortal combat?&quot;. Sir Walter Scott in his notes \non Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border recalled hearing a ballad of &quot;a fiend ... \npaying his addresses to a maid but being disconcerted by the holy herbs she wore \nin her bosom&quot;, and Lucy Broadwood goes so far as to suggest that the refrain \nmight be the survival of an incantation against such a suitor (which would fit \nwell with the plot of &quot;The Elfin Knight&quot;).\n\nContrary to current hearsay, none of the herbs listed in the song are \ncontraceptive or abortifacient plants ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ they are simply very common culinary \nherbs.\n\nThe refrain and the whole ballad may be the common pick up line: &quot;We're here for \na good time not a long time&quot;. Medieval peoples were simple folk but literature \nof the time suggests they had great wit particularly in the pursuit of love. By \ncheekily suggesting to an attractive passer by that you had a true love and \nsuggesting she had the Time to do all these impossible tasks, the singer is \nsending the impetuous message that love lies in wait and there is no time to \nwaste. All versions of the refrain seem to emphasize things that last forever in \ncontrast to the opportunity at hand. Modern exulted versions of the song \nemphasize an altruism that probably was out of place in rustic medieval times.\n\nOnce again, it must be noted that all of the possible alleged symbolism above is \nstrictly conjecture, especially since the &quot;parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme&quot; \nrefrain was not introduced until the late 18th century, many centuries after the \nMiddle Ages were over.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                             WAKE UP LITTLE SUSIE\n*******************************************************************************\n\n&quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot; is a popular song written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant \nand published in 1957.\n\nThe song is best known in a recording by The Everly Brothers, issued by Cadence \nRecords as catalog number 1337. The song reached #1 on the Billboard Pop and \nCountry charts and the Cash Box Best Selling Record charts, despite having been \nbanned from Boston radio stations for its supposedly suggestive lyrics.  It got \nto #2 on the United Kingdom song charts.\n\nAmong notable musical groups performing covers of the song are Simon and \nGarfunkel and the Grateful Dead. During their &quot;Old Friends&quot; tour in 2003-2004, \nSimon and Garfunkel performed this song and others in a segment with the Everly \nBrothers, who toured in support. Simon and Garfunkel have cited the Everly \nBrothers as strong influences on their own music. The musical duo Evan and Jaron \nalso recorded a version of the song on their album, &quot;52 Sundays.&quot;\n\nIn an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show during the 2000 U.S. presidential \nelection, Governor George W. Bush named &quot;Wake Up Little Susie&quot; as his favorite \nsong, erroneously claiming it was by Buddy Holly. Holly never recorded the song.\n\nThe song is written from the point of view of a high school boy to his \ngirlfriend, Susie. In the song, the two go out on a date to a drive-in movie \ntheater, only to fall asleep during the movie. They do not wake up until 4 \no'clock in the morning. They then contemplate the reactions of her parents and \ntheir friends.\n\nAlthough banned in such places as Boston, the song does not state that Susie and \nher boyfriend had sexual relations. Indeed, it strongly implies that they did \nnot: the couple simply fell asleep because they were bored by the film.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                              APRIL COME SHE WILL\n*******************************************************************************\n\nUtilizing the changing seasons as a metaphor for the capriciousness of a girl, \n&quot;April Come She Will&quot; was used very effectively in the film The Graduate and its \nsoundtrack. Written in England in 1964 following a brief affair that Paul Simon \nhad during his stay there, the lyrics were inspired by a nursery rhyme that the \ngirl in question recited. The sense of yearning in this song would later be \nbeautifully echoed in one of the Parsley, Sage, Rosemary &amp; Thyme masterpieces, \n&quot;For Emily, Wherever I May Find Her.&quot; Like that song, it is very brief, yet the \nshortness of the song adds to the effectiveness and economy of both the lyric \nand melody.

The song \nfirst appeared on There Goes Rhymin' Simon (1973), Simon's second solo album \nfollowing the breakup of Simon and Garfunkel. It was also released as a single, \nColumbia 45900, backed with &quot;One Man's Ceiling Is Another Man's Floor,&quot; which \nSimon released on the same album. The single eventually reached #35 on the \nBillboard charts in the United States.\n\nLyrically, the song is an evocation of weariness and confusion, as the narrator \ndescribes being far from home and &quot;wonder[ing] what's gone wrong.&quot; The lyrics \ninclude a dream image of the Statue of Liberty &quot;sailing away to sea&quot; and rueful \nmentions of the Mayflower and the Apollo program, before concluding &quot;it's all \nright/You can't be forever blessed/Still tomorrow's going to be another working \nday/And I'm trying to get some rest.&quot; Simon has stated in interviews that he \nwrote the song following Richard Nixon's re-election, and that it was meant to \nsum up his disappointment with the result\n\nThe tune is based on a melody line from Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale from \n&quot;St. Matthew Passion,&quot; itself a reworking of an earlier secular song, &quot;Mein \nGmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼th ist mir verwirret,&quot; composed by Hans Hassler.\n\nThe song was also featured on at least one episode of the NBC television series \nProvidence. It is included in an episode of The Wonder Years. The song is also \nalluded to in the lyrics of &quot;Independence Day&quot; by Ferron on the Driver CD: \n&quot;There's a Paul Simon song that just tears me apart...about the Statue of \nLiberty and hole in a heart.&quot;\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                             KODACHROME/MAYBELLENE\n*******************************************************************************\n\n&quot;Kodachrome&quot; is a song written and recorded by Paul Simon. It appeared on his \n1973 album There Goes Rhymin' Simon.\n\nThe song is named after the Kodak 35mm Film Kodachrome. He also made a reference \non the line &quot;I got a Nikon Camera&quot;. The song became a major hit in the United \nStates, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart as well as the Billboard \nadult contemporary chart, but it was not released as a single in Britain \nbecause, according to American Top 40 host Casey Kasem, the British Broadcasting \nCorporation would not play the trademarked name.\n\nKodak required the album to note that Kodachrome is a trademark of Kodak. In the \nlate 1990s, Kodak used the song in commercials to sell film.\n\nThe lyrics on There Goes Rhymin' Simon differed in wording from those on the The \nConcert in Central Park and Paul Simon's Concert in the Park, August 15, 1991 \nalbums. The former said, &quot;...everything looks worse in black and white,&quot; but the \nlatter said, &quot;...everything looks better in black and white.&quot;\n\nThis song is also featured in the 1993 film Coneheads. This song is played while \nthey show home videos of Connie Conehead growing up in the 1970s.\n\nKodachrome is also featured as the music for a level on the Commercial Data \nSystems Commodore 64 game Frantic Freddie\n\n&quot;Maybellene&quot; is a song by Chuck Berry that tells the story of a hot rod race and \na broken romance. It was released in July 1955 as a single on Chess Records of \nChicago, Illinois. It was Berry's first single release, and his first hit. \n&quot;Maybellene&quot; is considered one of the pioneering rock and roll singles: Rolling \nStone magazine said, &quot;Rock &amp; roll guitar starts here.&quot; The record is an early \ninstance of the complete rock and roll package: youthful subject matter, small \nguitar-driven combo, clear diction, and an atmosphere of unrelenting excitement.\n\nIn 1955, the song, a 12-bar blues, peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard rock charts, \nand was a #1 R&amp;B hit. Chuck was the first African American to reach the top ten \non the Billboard list with a rock and roll single. In 2004, &quot;Maybellene&quot; was \nranked number 18 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest songs of \nall time. In 1999, National Public Radio included it in the &quot;NPR 100,&quot; the one \nhundred most important American musical works of the 20th century as chosen by \nNPR music editors.\n\nThe title is often misspelled as Maybelline, even on some of Berry's own \ncompilation CDs. That spelling is used by a popular cosmetics line. Berry had \nworked as a hairdresser prior to beginning his musical career.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                          BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER\n*******************************************************************************\n\nhis song's recording process exposed many of the underlying tensions that \neventually led to the breakup of the group after the album's completion. Most \nnotably, Paul Simon has repeatedly expressed regret that he allowed Art \nGarfunkel to sing this song as a solo, as it focused attention on Garfunkel and \nrelegated Simon to a backing position. Art Garfunkel initially did not want to \nsing lead vocal, feeling it was not right for him. &quot;He felt I should have done \nit,&quot; Paul Simon revealed to Rolling Stone in 1972. Garfunkel said that the \nmoment when he performed it in Madison Square Garden in 1972 was &quot;almost \nbiblical&quot;. In recent performances on the &quot;Old Friends&quot; tour, Simon and Garfunkel \nhave taken turns singing alternate verses of the vocal.\n\nAs the song ends, drums and piano build in a crescendo to an extraordinary \nclimax. The last note, on a violin, is a long, drawn out E-flat that lasts ten \nseconds.\n\nSimon wrote the song in the summer of 1969 while Garfunkel was filming Catch-22 \nin Mexico. It was written on the guitar in the key of G although on an early \ndemo version Paul Simon detuned the song on his guitar to an F.\n\nThe song originally had two verses and different lyrics. Simon specifically \nwrote it for Garfunkel and knew it would be a piano song. He based the lyrics on \nthe line &quot;I'll be your bridge over deep water if you trust in me&quot; by Swan \nSilvertones in the song &quot;Oh Mary Don't You Weep For Me&quot;.\n\nGarfunkel reportedly liked Simon's falsetto on the demo and suggested Simon \nsing. He and producer Roy Halee also thought the song needed three verses and a \n'bigger' sound. Simon agreed and wrote the final verse.\n\nGarfunkel's first two attempts to record the vocal failed. The first two verses \nwere finally recorded in New York with the final verse recorded in Los Angeles.\n\nLarry Knechtel spent four days working on the piano arrangement. Art came up \nwith the intermediate piano chords between the verses while working with \nKnechtel.\n\nIt won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and Song of the Year in the \nGrammy Awards of 1971, with its album also winning several awards in the same \nyear.\n\nA gospel-inspired cover version by Aretha Franklin, taken from her album Aretha \nLive at Fillmore West, later won the Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal \nPerformance in the 1972 awards. In 1999, BMI named it as the 19th-most performed \nsong of the 20th century. Rolling Stone named it number 47 on The 500 Greatest \nSongs of All Time. In 2006, it was awarded 4th place in Australian TV show 20 to \n1's Greatest Songs of All Time episode, beaten by &quot;(I Can't Get No) \nSatisfaction&quot; by The Rolling Stones, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; by Led Zeppelin and \n&quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                                   THE BOXER\n*******************************************************************************\n\nThe original recording of the song is one of the duo's most highly produced, and \ntook over 100 hours to record. The recording was performed at multiple \nlocations, including Nashville, St. Paul's Church in New York city, and Columbia \nstudios. Drummer Hal Blaine created the huge drum sound heard during the chorus \nby banging a heavy chain against the concrete floor of an empty storage closet.\n\nThe version originally released on single by the duo features an instrumental \nmelody written by Art Garfunkel and played in unison on pedal steel guitar and \npiccolo trumpet. The song also features a bass harmonica heard during the second \nand final verses.\n\nThe song was originally written and performed in the key of B Major, but due to \ntape-speed variation, sounds about a quarter of a semitone closer to C Major.\n\nThe song's lyrics take the form of a first-person lament, as the singer \ndescribes his struggles to overcome loneliness and poverty in New York City. The \nfinal verse switches to a third-person sketch of a boxer, who, despite the \neffects of &quot;every glove that laid him down or cut him 'til he cried out&quot;, \nperseveres.\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that the lyrics represent a &quot;sustained attack on Bob \nDylan&quot;. Bob Dylan thought the song was about him, in turn covering it on his \nSelf Portrait album. Yet Paul Simon himself has suggested that the lyrics are \nlargely autobiographical, written during a time when he felt he was being \nunfairly criticized:\n\n    &quot;I think I was reading the Bible around that time. That's where I think \nphrases such as 'workman's wages' came from, and 'seeking out the poorer \nquarters'. That was biblical. I think the song was about me: everybody's beating \nme up, and I'm telling you now I'm going to go away if you don't stop.&quot;\n\nThe chorus of the song is wordless, consisting of a repeated chant of \n&quot;lie-la-lie&quot;. Simon stated that this was due to a lapse on his part:\n\n    &quot;I didn't have any words! Then people said it was 'lie' but I didn't really \nmean that. That it was a lie. But, it's not a failure of songwriting, because \npeople like that and they put enough meaning into it, and the rest of the song \nhas enough power and emotion, I guess, to make it go, so it's all right. But for \nme, every time I sing that part... [softly], I'm a little embarrassed.&quot;\n\n &quot;Missing&quot; verse\n\n&quot;The Boxer&quot; was originally written with a verse that is not present in the \nBridge Over Troubled Water version:\n\n    Now the years are rolling by me\n    They are rocking evenly\n    And I am older than I once was\n    And younger than I'll be, but that's not unusual.\n    No, it isn't strange\n    After changes upon changes\n    We are more or less the same\n    After changes we are more or less the same\n\nThis &quot;missing verse&quot; was performed by Simon and Garfunkel when they went on tour \nin November 1969, and Paul Simon when he performed it solo after the group's \nbreakup. Simon and Garfunkel also performed the &quot;missing verse&quot; on Saturday \nNight Live in 1975 and when they reunited for The Concert in Central Park in \n1981, and on Late Show with David Letterman.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                 THE 59th STREET BRIDGE SONG (FEELIN' GROOVY)\n*******************************************************************************\n\nIs a short and whimsical song by folk music duo Simon and Garfunkel, appearing \non their 1966 album Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme. &quot;59th Street Bridge&quot; is \nthe colloquial name of the Queensboro Bridge in New York City. The song's \nmessage is immediately delivered in its opening verse: &quot;Slow down, you move too \nfast&quot;. The song is soft, melodic, and relaxing, yet uplifting.\n\n*******************************************************************************\n                             THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE\n*******************************************************************************\n\n&quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; is the song that propelled the 1960s folk music duo \nSimon and Garfunkel to popularity. It was written on February 19, 1964 by Paul \nSimon in the aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on \nNovember 22, 1963. Simon conceived of the song as a way of capturing the \nemotional trauma felt by many Americans.\n\nThe song features Simon on acoustic guitar and both Simon and Garfunkel singing. \nIt was originally recorded as an acoustic piece for their first album Wednesday \nMorning, 3 A.M., but was later overdubbed with electric instruments and \nre-released as a single in September 1965. The single slowly climbed the charts \nuntil it reached number one on New Year's Day 1966. The song was included in the \n1966 album Sounds of Silence.\n\nThe song was originally called &quot;The Sounds of Silence,&quot; and is titled that way \non the early albums in which it appeared and on the single. In later \ncompilations, it was retitled &quot;The Sound of Silence.&quot; Both the singular and the \nplural form of the word appear in the lyrics.\n\nThe song was used three times in the film The Graduate, played during the \nopening credits and the closing footage, and in the film Bobby, where it is \nplayed during Robert Kennedy's victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel, just \nbefore his assassination.\n\nSimon began working on the song sometime after the Kennedy assassination. He had \nmade progress on the music, but had yet to get down the lyrics. On 19 February \n1964, the lyrics apparently coalesced, and Simon showed the new composition to \nGarfunkel the same day. Shortly afterwards, the duo began to perform it at folk \nclubs in New York, and included it on their debut album, Wednesday Morning, 3 \nA.M., released that October. The album flopped upon its release, and the duo \nsplit up, with Simon going to England for much of 1965. There he often performed \nthe song solo in folk clubs, and recorded it for a second time on his solo LP in \nMay 1965, The Paul Simon Songbook.\n\nIn the meantime, Simon and Garfunkel's producer at Columbia Records in New York, \nTom Wilson, had learned that the song had begun to receive airplay on radio \nstations in Boston, Massachusetts and around Gainesville and Cocoa Beach, \nFlorida.\n\nOn 15 June 1965, immediately after the recording session of Bob Dylan's &quot;Like a \nRolling Stone,&quot; Wilson took the original track of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and \noverdubbed the recording with electric guitar (played by Al Gorgoni), electric \nbass (Bob Bushnell), and drums (Bobby Gregg), and released it as a single \nwithout even consulting Simon or Garfunkel. The song entered the U.S. pop charts \nin September 1965 and slowly began its ascent.\n\nSimon learned that it had entered the charts minutes before he went on stage to \nperform at a club in Copenhagen, Denmark, and in the later fall of 1965 he \nreturned to the United States. By the end of 1965 and the first few weeks of \n1966, the song reached number one on the U.S. charts. Simon and Garfunkel then \nreunited as a musical group, and included the song as the title track of their \nnext album, Sounds of Silence, hastily recorded in December 1965 and released in \nJanuary 1966 to capitalize on their success. The song propelled them to stardom \nand, together with two other top-five (in the U.S.) hits in the summer of 1966, \n&quot;I Am a Rock&quot; and &quot;Homeward Bound,&quot; ensured the duo's fame. In 1999, BMI named \n&quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; as the 18th-most performed song of the 20th century. In \n2004 it was ranked #156 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All \nTime, one of the duo's three songs on the list.\n\nOne variation was a promotional release on red vinyl. This copy was unique in \nthat it featured the original acoustic version found on Wednesday Morning, 3 \nA.M. on one side and the electric overdubbed version later featured on Sounds of \nSilence on the other. This release was mainly distributed to radio stations and \ncarries a white label. This version is rare to find today, and quite valuable to \ncollectors.\n\nThe standard version of the single was released on black vinyl, with a red label \nthe same Columbia catalog number, and backed with &quot;We've Got a Groovey Thing \nGoin'.&quot; The now-passÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© adjective is normally spelled &quot;Groovy,&quot; as it would be on \ntheir later issue, &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy).&quot;\n\n&quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; was later released in the 1970s on the Columbia &quot;Hall of \nFame&quot; series, catalog number 13-3396, which featured back-to-back hits of a \ngroup on 45. This time the song was backed by &quot;Homeward Bound.&quot;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll info taken from wikipedia, except where other source is stated.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a4160bda5cb88f847826eb1a48a309c7afa1d0","amp;dn":"Simon+%26+Garfunkel+-+The+Concert+In+Central+Park+%5BRePoPo%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a4160bda5cb88f847826eb1a48a309c7afa1d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,164,22,11,218,92,184,143,132,120,38,235,26,72,163,9,199,175,161,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
