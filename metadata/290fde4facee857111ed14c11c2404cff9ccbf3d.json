In all these years, the United States has never charged him with a crime. A federal judge ordered his release in March 2010, but the U.S. government fought that decision, and there is no sign that the United States plans to let him go.\n\nThree years into his captivity Slahi began a diary, recounting his life before he disappeared into U.S. custody, &quot;his endless world tour&quot; of imprisonment and interrogation, and his daily life as a GuantÃƒÂ¡namo prisoner. His diary is not merely a vivid record of a miscarriage of justice, but a deeply personal memoirÃ¢â‚¬â€-terrifying, darkly humorous, and surprisingly gracious. Published now for the first time, GUANTÃƒï¿½NAMO DIARY is a document of immense historical importance and a riveting and profoundly revealing read","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:290fde4facee857111ed14c11c2404cff9ccbf3d","amp;dn":"Mohamedou+Ould+Slahi+-+Guant%26aacute%3Bnamo+Diary+%282015%29+%5Bepub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"290fde4facee857111ed14c11c2404cff9ccbf3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,15,222,79,172,238,133,113,17,237,20,193,28,36,4,207,249,204,191,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
