They were born in Skegness, Lincolnshire, England. While Bonnet stayed in England, Trevor Gordon grew up in Australia where he met The Bee Gees for the first time in 1964, and recorded four songs with them. In 1967 Bonnet founded a group called &quot;The Blue Sect&quot;, and Trevor Gordon followed a request to join this band. In 1968 they became &quot;The Marbles&quot;, and signed a recording contract with the Australian record label impressario, Robert Stigwood. They were befriended by Barry Gibb and Maurice Gibb who wrote six songs for them, and provided some background vocals.\nThe Marbles were typical one-hit wonders because &quot;Only One Woman&quot; became their one and only major hit. It reached Number 5 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1968. Their second single &quot;The Walls Fell Down&quot; only reached Number 28 in the same chart. But in Holland it was more successful, where it reached Number 3 in their Top 40 in April 1969.\nBy 1969 the Marbles had split. While Gordon retired from the music industry, Bonnet started a lengthy solo career. From 1978 to 1980 he was the lead singer with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marbles_(Duo)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marbles_(Duo)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBefore scaling the hard rock heights with Rainbow and Alcatrazz, Graham Bonnet belted out contemporary covers with his cousin, Trevor Gordon, in the Marbles. Born in Lincolnshire, England, Bonnet performed with a blues band and a jazz trio before hooking up with Gordon, who played with the Bee Gees, and the Marbles caught the interest of media mogul Robert Stigwood at RSO Records. The first Marbles single, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOnly One WomanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a Gibb Brothers composition, did well in the U.K. and Australia. Another Gibb tune, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Walls Fell Down,&quot; also received airplay, but the Marbles abruptly broke up. Transitory behavior would become typical of Bonnet's career. Though the band split in late 1969, the eponymous Marbles debut was released in 1970. ~ Whitney Z.
