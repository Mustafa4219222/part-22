The\n   respective exits of two band members and being dropped from their label would\n   have caused many bands to fold.  Instead, J. Loren (vocals, guitar, violin)\n   and Paul Spatola (guitar, piano), together with new members Rek Mohr (bass)\n   and Louie Sciancalepore (drums) are kicking down any obstacles that may have\n   been laid out before them.\n\n   For this albumÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s recording process, Hurt took a step back in time by\n   embracing legacy recording methodology.  They used analog equipment and\n   recorded to tapeÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  the way it used to be done before digital recording\n   technology blossomed in the 1990ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s.  Hurt proved their mettle by conquering\n   what is now considered a laborious process, and the result is crystal clear.\n   This albumÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s sound has a richness sorely lacking in much of todayÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â s rock\n   music.  Audiophiles will be happy to note that this album may also be\n   released on vinyl.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
