Dick's Picks, Vol. 21 contains \none such performance. Documented at the Richmond Coliseum \non November 1, 1985, this show remains a favorite from \nthe mid'80s among Deadheads in the know. In addition, \nthese three discs also include well over half an hour of \nmaterial from the Community War Memorial in Rochester, NY, \non September 2, 1980. Why just this fragment? According to \nvault keeper David Lemieux, &quot;All we had in the vault of \nthat show is what we are releasing here.&quot; One of the main \nreasons this performance ranks so highly is an above average \nsong selection. For instance, &quot;Stagger Lee,&quot; &quot;Comes a Time,\n&quot; and a cover of Dylan's &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; are all 1985 \nrevivals. While some material stayed out of the rotation \nlonger than others, the influx and overall diversion from \nroutine make more common fodder such as &quot;Me and My Uncle,&quot; \n&quot;Big River,&quot; or &quot;Jack Straw&quot; considerably more palatable. \nThere are also some unpredictable moments. The most notable \noccurs during the second set as &quot;Lost Sailor&quot; and &quot;Saint of \nCircumstance&quot; which are usually played together are done \nseparately. This show happens to be the sole occurrence in \nwhich both songs are performed, but not sequentially. An \nunusually animated Bob Weir demonstrates his attributes and \nsupport to the aural athletics taking place during a rare \ncover of &quot;Gloria.&quot; The nearly 40 minutes of music from \nSeptember 2, 1980, was added because it contains some amazing \nmusic, and because there was a significant amount of time \navailable on the third disc after the &quot;feature presentation.&quot; \nThe brilliant and economical idea to incorporate these \notherwise useless fragments of music is solved proving once \nagain that necessity can still be the mother of invention.\n\n- Lindsay Planer, All Music Guide\n\n\n\n***Set 1***\n01. \tDancing in the Streets &gt; \t\n02. \tCold Rain and Snow \t\n03. \tLittle Red Rooster \t\n04. \tStagger Lee \t\n05. \tMe &amp; My Uncle\n06. \tBig River\n07. \tBrown-Eyed Woman\n08. \tJack Straw &gt;\n09. \tDon't Ease Me In\n\n***Set 2***\n01. \tSamson and Delilah \t\n02. \tHigh Time \t\n03. \tHe's Gone &gt;\t\n04. \tSpoonful &gt;\n05. \tComes a Time &gt;\n06. \tLost Sailor &gt;\n07. \tDrums &gt;\n08. \tSpace &gt; \t\n09. \tSaint of Circumstance &gt; \t\n10. \tGimme Some Lovin' &gt; \t\n11. \tShe Belongs to Me &gt;\t\n12. \tGloria \t\n\n***Encore*** \t\n13.
