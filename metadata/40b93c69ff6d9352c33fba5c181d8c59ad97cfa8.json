The rivals met for a rematch that would never be finished, as Tyson earned a disqualification and infamy that followed in the third round by biting off a portion of HolyfieldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ear. Through nearly 100 interviews, including with the famed fighters themselves, and extensive research of past interviews, books, and transcripts, this exploration of the sensational events surrounding the fight provides a behind-the-scenes, past and present look at the bout.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/books/1366073560l/16144130.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/books/1366073560l/16144130.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nabout author :-\n\nGEORGE WILLIS HAS been a general sports columnist at the New York\nPost since February 1997, and has been the primary boxing writer\nsince 2002.
