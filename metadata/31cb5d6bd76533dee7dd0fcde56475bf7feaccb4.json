It is known best for its\ncommercially successful disco songs, including &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance (Yowsah, Yowsah, Yowsah)&quot;\n(1977), &quot;Everybody Dance&quot; (1977), &quot;Le Freak&quot; (1978), &quot;I Want Your Love&quot; (1978), &quot;Good Times&quot;\n(1979), and &quot;My Forbidden Lover&quot; (1979).\n\nThe group regarded themselves as a rock band for the disco movement &quot;that made good on hippie\npeace, love and freedom&quot;.In October 2013, Chic was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll\nHall of Fame for the ninth time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBox Set Review (c/o Amazon)\n\nIn preparation for over 10 years, but now it's finally here. The offically Chic box set,\nteasingly titled 'volume 1', lives quite easily up to its anticipations it gathered over\nthe last decade. To be more precise; this box set is a dream come true. 4 cd's jam-packed\nwith all the glorious stuff that mrs Edward &amp; Rodgers released upon us from the late 70's\nuntill the early 80's. They are all here in excellent mastered quality and all in their most\nstriking form, appearing at 12&quot; or at album lenght. Mr Rodgers also has thrown in some\nsuprises; unreleased tracks by Fonzi Thornton and Chic, unreleased long version of tracks\nby Norma Jean and Fonzi Thornton and some studio outtakes. All excellent stuff.\n\nAn even bigger treat in this box set, are 5 exclusive remixes by Dimitri from Paris.\nHaving access to the original multi-tracks Dimitri works his magic on Norma Jean's\n'Saturday night' (a 10 minute 'goose- bumping' symphony), Chic's 'I want your love'\nand later days 'I feel your love coming on' and Sister Sledges 'Thinking of you' and\n'Lost in music' (where Kathy Sledges vocal ad libs at the end of the original, appear\nas new vocals in this version; quite brilliant!).And then there are 3 tracks from the\n-as yet- unreleased Johnny Mathis album.\n\nStrangely, this box set is not released internationally(as it most certainly deserves),\nbut only domestically in France. The emphasis on this box set is purely on the music,\nas it should. It is the compilation to end all previous compilations. It's a masterpiece.
