Their break turned the Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War - which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially recognised.\n\n\nGeneral\nComplete name :H:\\Code Breakers Bletchley Parks Lost Heroes.\nFormat                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 550 MiB\nDuration                         : 59mn 5s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 301 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nDuration                         : 59mn 5s\nBit rate                         : 1 165 Kbps\nWidth                            : 624 pixels\nHeight                           : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio: Version 1 Layer 3 Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 59mn 4s\nBit rate                         : 123 Kbps Variable\nMinimum bit rate                 : 32.0 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de479165daaef00c751d46e3b48c44398e175185","amp;dn":"Code+Breakers+Bletchley+Parks+Lost+Heroes%28xvid%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de479165daaef00c751d46e3b48c44398e175185","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,71,145,101,218,174,240,12,117,29,70,227,180,140,68,57,142,23,81,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
