Simply mount, install and play. Check the system requirements included in the .iso for installing troubleshoot.\n\nMost of the games run under modern (Windows!) operating systems. If a game cannot be installed because it requires Windows 95, right click on setup.exe, click properties, go to compatibility and select Windows 95. Apply and you are good to go. Some games like Timon and PumbaaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jungle Games may not work on some operating systems. \nNo game should require the original CD in order to play. But if they do, use regedit.exe to delete their registry.\nSome games are emulated using DosBos, thus having different requirements. Check the end of the document.\nThose are the English versions of the games, although Atlantis has the installer in Russian. \nSome games donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work on Windows 8.1, use VirtualBox to create a virtual Windows XP/98SE and play them.\n\nGame List: \nAladdin\nAladdin: NashiraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Revenge\nAtlantis: The Lost Empire\nChip and Dale: Rescue Rangers\nDuck Tales Quest for Gold\nDuck Tales Remastered \nHercules\nHades Challenge\nTarzan\nThe Jungle Book\nThe Lion King\nThe Lion King II: SimbaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pride\nTimon and PumbaaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jungle Games\nWinnie the Pooh\nTiggerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Honey Hunt\n\nNew in version 2.0:\n101 Dalmatians Escape from DeVil Manor\n102 Dalmatians Puppies to the Rescue\nBeauty and the Beast\nBrother Bear\nFinding Nemo\nMonsters Inc Mikes Monstrous Adventure\nMonsters Inc Scare Island Game\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame Topsy Turvy Games\nToy Story\nToy Story 2\nI've also added descriptions and screenshots for each game.\n-------------------------\nI'm looking for no cd crack for the following games:\nDonald Duck Quack Attack\nDisney Mickey Saves the Day\nA BugÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Life\n-------------------------\nThe .iso can be burned on a double layer DVD and I've included a cover. However I'm looking for a serious cover designer, willing to spend 30 minutes on creating a nice cover for collectors. \n-------------------------\nThe menu is optimized for a resolution of 1366x768 which is the most common resolution. Lower resolutions such as 1280x1024 did not provide enough space to place all the items, and the 4:3 aspect would bother widescreen users. \n-------------------------\nTo answer most common questions: \nI do not consider Star Wars games as classic Disney games.\nWall-E and ToyStory 3 are not included because of their size and the fact that they are relatively new.\n-------------------------\nI'm free for suggestions and constructive criticism. I won't release version 3 until I find someone to do the cover and find a crack for some of the games listed above. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a001c612c18b6ac8ce3fec4a3a544cf98d7c995b","amp;dn":"Disney+Classic+Games+Collection+Version+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a001c612c18b6ac8ce3fec4a3a544cf98d7c995b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,1,198,18,193,139,106,200,206,63,236,74,58,84,76,249,141,124,153,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
