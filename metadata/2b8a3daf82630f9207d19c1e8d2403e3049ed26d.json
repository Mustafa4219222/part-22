From out of the bohemian underground and into the pop mainstream, the psychedelic era produced some of the most ground-breaking music ever made, pioneered by young improvising bands like Soft Machine and Pink Floyd, then quickly taken to the charts by the likes of the Beatles, Procol Harum, the Small Faces and the Moody Blues, even while being reimagined in the country by bucolic, folk-based artists like the Incredible String Band and Vashti Bunyan.\r\n\r\nThe film is narrated by Nigel Planer with contributions and freshly-shot performances from artists who lived and breathed the psych revolution - Paul McCartney, Ginger Baker, Robert Wyatt, Roy Wood, the Zombies, Mike Heron, Vashti Bunyan, Joe Boyd, Gary Brooker, Arthur Brown, Kenney Jones, Barry Miles, the Pretty Things and the Moody Blues.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2294Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 93.5Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1015 MB\r\nSource: Webrip BBC iPlayer\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8a3daf82630f9207d19c1e8d2403e3049ed26d","amp;dn":"Psychedelic+Britannia+720p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8a3daf82630f9207d19c1e8d2403e3049ed26d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,138,61,175,130,99,15,146,7,209,156,30,141,36,3,227,4,158,210,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
