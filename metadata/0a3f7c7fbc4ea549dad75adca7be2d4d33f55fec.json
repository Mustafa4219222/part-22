This film captures Abbey's iconoclastic spirit wonderfully... so well that those of us who loved his writing (fiction and non-fiction) grieve anew for America's loss. Abbey fought hard (without taking himself for a saint) for the West... all too often a place trashed for greed at the expense of those who love it (including its wildlife). Every school ought to have a copy of this film. Every woman and man who loves the planet ought to have a copy. And we should all show it to as many friends as we have.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a3f7c7fbc4ea549dad75adca7be2d4d33f55fec","amp;dn":"A+Voice+in+the+Wilderness+-+%28PBS+Doc+on+Edward+Abbey%292005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a3f7c7fbc4ea549dad75adca7be2d4d33f55fec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,63,124,127,188,78,165,73,218,215,90,220,167,190,45,77,51,245,95,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
