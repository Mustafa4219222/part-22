Unlike Root, Shaw is unable at this time to get a new identity from the Machine, meaning that Shaw has to go into hiding. On the flip side, Greer and Martine have to figure out why Samaritan is/was unable to identify Shaw as they still track her, which they hope will lead to Finch and the rest of the team. With Shaw and Root preoccupied with their immediate task of making their way back to Finch's headquarters using all the camera free zones, Reese is in charge of protecting their next number, namely the team's old friend, Carl Elias. Despite Elias' illegal dealings, they know that they have to protect him against the Brotherhood as Elias has at least maintained order in the criminal world, which the Brotherhood would not do in Elias' place. It seems as if the Brotherhood is able to get to some of Elias' men. \n\nÃ‚Â \n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4133554/?ref_=tt_eps_rhs_2&quot;&gt;IMDB&lt;/a&gt;\nRatings: 8.3/10 from 24 users   \nÃ‚Â \nEncoding Information\nGeneral           : Person.of.Interest.S04E09.720p.HDTV.QAAC.x264-xRed\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 1 031 Kbps\nLength            : 320 MiB for 43mn 26s 980ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 781 Kbps\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 243 Kbps\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f419e3eb51c0f14d461344882b44edd99471de1e","amp;dn":"Person+of+Interest+S04E09+720p+HDTV+QAAC+x264-xRed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f419e3eb51c0f14d461344882b44edd99471de1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,25,227,235,81,192,241,77,70,19,68,136,43,68,237,217,148,113,222,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
