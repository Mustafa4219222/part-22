Converted to NTSC, authored chapters (by music video), and made a nice little package out of it.  Neither cover is mine, both were downloaded *at some point*, one was downloaded from: http://www.motley.dk/sites/dvdcovers.htm  I did make some alterations.  I do have 2 VHS copies of D.O.D. however, I can't convert them over to DVD and since I found fairly decent covers I didn't feel the need to scan.  MÃƒÂ¶tleyLand Rocks!  \n\nPlease share the info file if you share this torrent anywhere else. \n\nThanks and enjoy!\n\n\nP.S. If anyone out there has - Dr. Feelgood The Videos - in a format (other than VHS - which I have) that can be shared online -- I'd love to get my grubby little hands on it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7823f3c282ddc903a2f5575afab66f318f3fbcc1","amp;dn":"Motley+Crue+-+Decade+Of+Decadence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7823f3c282ddc903a2f5575afab66f318f3fbcc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,35,243,194,130,221,201,3,162,245,87,90,250,182,111,49,143,63,188,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
