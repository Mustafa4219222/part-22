His efforts do not \ndisappoint here, as the motion picture soundtrack captures all of the magic, \nmystery, danger, and adventure that goes hand in hand with the filmed \njourney through Middle-Earth. It sounds as if each of the principle characters \nreceived a bit of a 'theme' of their own, and Shore weaves these throughout \nhis compositions with tremendous ease and success. If the soundtrack has \nany shortcomings, it's that it's too short: the film was nearly 3 hours long (the \nDVD allegedly will be over 4 hours) but the soundtrack is only 70+ minutes. A \nwonderful listen but definitely for fans of the movie only. \n\n1. The Prophecy \n2. Concerning Hobbits \n3. The Shadow Of The Past \n4. The Treason Of Isengard \n5. The Black Rider \n6.
