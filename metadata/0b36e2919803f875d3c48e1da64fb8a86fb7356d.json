This scenery has been created by Andras Kozma (a native of Budapest) and well known for his award winning scenery projects! \n\nBudapest is the capital of Hungary and one of the oldest cities in Central Europe. ItÃƒÂ¢??s history is rich and varied, with many highlights and several very sad periods. With Hungary being the odd one out in the Soviet Block (it had more freedom then the other Eastern European states) it was able to recover from the devastation of the last part of World War II with much more style and feeling for its history then most other cities in Eastern Europe. As the thousands of tourists can testify to, it is a city that certainly deserves a visit. \n\nThe Budapest main airport, Ferihegy International Airport is the most important airport in Hungary and has handled over 8 million passengers last year. Large enough to handle B747 (and most likely the A380) it has connections to most European airports and has recently seen a big increase in low costs airline flights. MalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©v Hungarian Airlines is the main Hungarian airline and it has its home base at Ferihegy. MalÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©v and Delta operate flights from Budapest to New York. The three main terminals (1, 2A, 2B) and the General aviation terminal will be joined by a new Freight terminal soon and companies like UPS are starting to use Ferihegy more and more. Most striking on the airport is for sure the control tower, a large structure build up from ground level on two massive pillars. \n\nFS2004 edition (version1.30 and up) only! The city is fully covered with detailed buildings and monuments. All the additional airports around Budapest (LHBS, LHDK, LHFH, LHGD, LHHH and LHTL) are included as well in great detail.
