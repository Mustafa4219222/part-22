Despite it being very eccentric, very Edwardian and very British, Ian discovers that the book is actually very radical and addresses many issues that we think of as modern, such as citizenship, disaffected youth and social responsibility. Contributors include Baden-Powell&amp;#039;s grandson and biographer Tim Jeal.\n\nFile Information\n\nDVBT-T (Freeview) Capture\nConverted using Gordian Knot\nResolution = 640x352\nVideo Codec = XviD\nAudio = 128kbps CBR\n\n\nPlease keep seeding after you finish downloading.
