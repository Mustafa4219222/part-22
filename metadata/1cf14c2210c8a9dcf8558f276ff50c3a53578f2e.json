Furthermore, the songs are a little more concise and accessible than those of its predecessor. That doesn't mean Camel has abandoned art. \r\n\r\nMoonmadness is indeed a concept album, based loosely on the personalities of each member â€“ &quot;Chord Change&quot; is Peter Bardens, &quot;Air Born&quot; is Andy Latimer, &quot;Lunar Sea&quot; is Andy Ward and &quot;Another Night&quot; is Doug Ferguson. Certainly, it's a concept that is considerably less defined than that of Snow Goose, and the music isn't quite as challenging, yet that doesn't mean that Moonmadness is devoid of pleasure. In fact, with its long stretches of atmospheric instrumentals and spacy solos, it's quite rewarding.\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01. Aristillus [Instrumental Version]\r\n02. Song Within A Song\r\n03.
