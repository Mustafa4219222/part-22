Porup lived in South America for many years and traveled widely throughout the continent. American by birth, Australian by choice, Colombian by marriage and Canadian by accident, he escaped from the US in 1999 and plans to renounce his citizenship. His first editor--way back in the mid-90s--called him a loose cannon. Ever since he has done his best to live up to that high standard.\n\nThe Second Bat Guano War\nRats ate his baby daughter while he partied in a disco. Now Horace &quot;Horse&quot; Mann is a drugged-out expat teaching English to criminals in Lima, Peru. Oh, and doing the odd favor for the CIA.\n\nWhen his Agency contact, Pitt Waters, goes missing, Horse's desperate efforts to find his only friend lead him to a Buddhist ashram on the shores of Lake Titicaca. There Horse uncovers his friend's involvement with a group of Gaia-worshipping terrorists who want to kill off the human &quot;disease&quot; infecting the earth.\n\nCan Horse find his friend in time? And when he does--will he want to stop him?\n\nThe United States of Air: a Satire\n\nYou read Orwell's 1984.

For the first time ever, Frolick solves a murderÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å’but what he finds out shakes his faith.\n\nDeath on Taurus\nOn Taurus, there's only one good way to die.\n\nOn the bullfighting planet of Taurus, in the far distant future, a genetically engineered race of half-man, half-bull stages ritual blood sacrifices to the gods--human viewers light-years away. Vizzer, the high priest who presides over the daily slaughter, loathes the fights and wants to end them.\n\nWhen news arrives that the humans have destroyed themselves in an interstellar civil war, he deposes the king and outlaws the fights. But not all the humans are dead. Carlos the Creator lies in stasis on Taurus itself. Vizzer comes face to face with an enraged and ancient god.
