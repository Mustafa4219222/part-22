Arche, having moved to a new home in the town of Tonkiness, ended up attending the only school in the area. It is the school for children aspiring to be magic users: the Minasa-Ratis Magic School.\nFortune Summoners is a story about being young. It's a story about finding adventure, about doing good even when doing good is hard. It's a story about owning up to your mistakes and making them right, and facing down danger no matter what. Furthermore, it's a video game.\nGameplay in Fortune Summoners consists of side-scrolling action, with you in control of one of three party members and the computer controlling the other two (with highly customizable AI dictating their actions). You will explore towns, delve dungeons, climb towers and, just maybe, find Arche a snack or two.\nCombat is different depending on who you control - Arche, being a swords-girl, controls in a fashion similar to a character from a brawler or fighting game, with many special moves tied to button combos. Sana and Stella, her companions, rely more on their varied selection of spells to see them through a fight - spells that rain ice down on enemies, make mirror images of friends, or set the ground ablaze!\nTheir magic comes from elemental stones: stones imbued with the power of an Elemental Spirit, which grant the wielder of one the ability to control that element via &quot;magic&quot;. In the country of Scotsholm, three centuries have passed since they were first created. Elemental stones are now mass-produced and widely used, making magic a personal, commonplace part of people's lives.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A massive gameworld to explore - nearly a dozen dungeons to delve into, and easily 25+ hours of gameplay, with lots of extra content to explore!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Gorgeous, detailed 2D sprite backgrounds and animations - like the best 16-bit game you never got to play!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Classic platformer-RPG action in the vein of some of the true greats of yesteryear!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Conquer the challenges before you with intelligent AI companions - you can let them do as they want or customize their behavior to your heart's delight!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Stunning, professional-quality music and sound!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Full support for Xinput controllers, including the XBox 360 controller, as well as keyboards!\n\nSystem requirements:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows XP/Vista/7\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 1 GHz\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ 512 MB RAM","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de90b8dbb4512bed9a6b759fcfe380e7290afccf","amp;dn":"Fortune.Summoners.Secret.of.the.Elemental.Stone.v1.2.full-THETA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de90b8dbb4512bed9a6b759fcfe380e7290afccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,144,184,219,180,81,43,237,154,107,117,159,207,227,128,231,41,10,252,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
