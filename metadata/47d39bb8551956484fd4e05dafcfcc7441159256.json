This song is on their 2000 album Stiff Upper Lip, and it is composed by Angus and Malcolm Young. The song was released as a single, and topped the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It was performed on Saturday Night Live on March 18, 2000.\n\nThe music video, directed by Andy Morahan, starts with the band driving down the street in a red 1997 Hummer H1 when they get caught in a traffic jam. They then pull into a back alley, get out of the car, and commence to play the song on the street. The song that the band was listening to before the car jam was &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot;, a song released when the late Bon Scott was a member of the band.\n\nStiff Upper Lip is the 14th Australian and 13th international studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC; it was released in February 2000. The album was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York City. The album was produced by George Young, older brother of Malcolm and Angus Young. The three singles to be released from it were the title track, &quot;Safe in New York City&quot;, and &quot;Satellite Blues&quot;. These three songs plus &quot;Meltdown&quot; were played live on the subsequent world tour.\n\nThe album is currently certified platinum in the US for shipments in excess of 1,000,000 copies.\n\nAC/DC are an Australian rock band, formed in 1973 by brothers Malcolm and Angus Young. Although the band are commonly classified as hard rock and are considered a pioneer of heavy metal, they have always classified their music as rock and roll. To date they are one of the highest grossing bands of all time. AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, High Voltage, in 1975. Membership remained stable until bassist Mark Evans was replaced by Cliff Williams in 1978 for the album Powerage. Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980, after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group briefly considered disbanding, but Scott's parents urged them to continue and hire a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released their highest selling album, Back in Black.\n\nAs of 2010, AC/DC had sold more than 200 million albums worldwide, including 71 million albums in the United States alone. Back in Black has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the second-highest-selling album by any artist ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ behind only Michael Jackson's Thriller ÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ´ and the highest-selling album by any band. The album has sold 22 million units in the US alone, where it is the sixth-highest-selling album of all time. AC/DC ranked fourth on VH1's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot; and were named the seventh &quot;Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time&quot; by MTV. In 2004, AC/DC ranked No. 72 on the Rolling Stone list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Legendary producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for the Rolling Stone list, referred to AC/DC as &quot;the greatest rock and roll band of all time.&quot; In 2010, AC/DC were ranked number 23 in the VH1 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_Upper_Lip_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_Upper_Lip_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaCoLaAfJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaCoLaAfJ&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 9000kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Digital Audio 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:54\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
