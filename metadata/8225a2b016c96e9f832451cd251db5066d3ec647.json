The album was their most varied to date, with the discofied title track, the stately waltz &quot;Take It To the Limit,&quot; and the tough, cynical country rocker &quot;Lyin' Eyes.&quot; The album contains a couple of unusual numbers as well, including Bernie Leadon's psychedelic banjo showcase &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot; and &quot;I Wish You Peace,&quot; which Leadon wrote with his then-girlfriend, future first daughter (by virtue of her parents, Ron and Nancy\nReagan) and nude model (courtesy of Playboy), Patti Davis. --Daniel Durchholz\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.One of these nights                                  [04:48]\n02.Too many hands                                       [04:42]\n03.Hollywood waltz                                      [04:01]\n04.Journey of the sorcerer                              [06:37]\n05.Lyin' eyes                                           [06:23]\n06.Take it to the limit                                 [04:47]\n07.Visions                                              [03:56]\n08.After the thrill is gone                             [03:56]\n09.I wish you peace                                     [03:44]\n____\n\n42:54 min\n 65,2 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8225a2b016c96e9f832451cd251db5066d3ec647","amp;dn":"The_Eagles-One_Of_These_Nights-%28Retail%29-1975-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8225a2b016c96e9f832451cd251db5066d3ec647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,37,162,176,22,201,110,159,131,36,81,205,37,29,181,6,109,62,198,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
