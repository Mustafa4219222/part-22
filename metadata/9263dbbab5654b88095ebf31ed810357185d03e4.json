Now they will ramp up properly and eventually, probably, kill you. But hey, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the drama!\nAlpha4d lengthened the ramp-up time for challenge. It also adds a Ã¢â‚¬Å“need sawmillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ alert to reduce confusion around the wood planks system.\nAlpha4e rebalanced the storytellers again in light of this poll.\nSorry for all the hotfixes. Testing storytellers properly is really hard. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re working on some automated metrics so balancing wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be such a scattershot process in the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9263dbbab5654b88095ebf31ed810357185d03e4","amp;dn":"RimWorldAlpha4e+Mac+OS+X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9263dbbab5654b88095ebf31ed810357185d03e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,99,219,186,181,101,75,136,9,94,191,49,237,129,3,87,24,93,3,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
