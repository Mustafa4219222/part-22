The lucrative mission is fraught with dangerous weather, where a minor pilot error could lead to tragedy.\n\nSteve puts together a crew he can trust. He contracts Aidan Loehr, a mountaineer and adventurer who lives out of his truck, to team up with Dave Doble, one of his local stalwarts. Steve hopes that this trip will help Dave get back on the saddle, because his previous mission ended after he prematurely aborted the second leg.  While Dave and Aidan have never flown together before, Steve hopes the duo will make a good team.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3de44736c1c0d4f28677f71fcaf8d61b1dd9f422","amp;dn":"plane+xtreme+S01E03+double+delivery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3de44736c1c0d4f28677f71fcaf8d61b1dd9f422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,228,71,54,193,192,212,242,134,119,247,31,202,248,214,27,29,217,244,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
