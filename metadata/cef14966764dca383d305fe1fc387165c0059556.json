He does have one male friend, Masashi, but all the rest are female. The stories are fairly episodic, and the tone of the series is quite laid back. Each episode focuses on rather ordinary things, such as seating placement in class, clean up duty, etc. There&amp;#039;s nothing in the series which would have you on the edge of your seat. Everything on the whole looks pretty normal for these people. They do everyday things, but it leaves you feeling good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef14966764dca383d305fe1fc387165c0059556","amp;dn":"%5BExiled-Destiny%5D_To_Heart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef14966764dca383d305fe1fc387165c0059556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,241,73,102,118,77,202,56,61,48,95,225,252,56,113,101,192,5,149,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
