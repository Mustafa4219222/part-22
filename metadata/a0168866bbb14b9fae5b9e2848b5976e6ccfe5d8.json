HeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s parlayed this vocation into a \n\nsuccessful book release that one day draws the attention of Angel \n\nSanchez (Forest Whitaker), a profoundly troubled man fixated on the \n\nÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â£untimelyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ã‚Â¥ death of his mother. When Carter takes on Sanchez as a \n\npersonal client in an effort to raise funds for his indebted brother \n\nBen (Mike Epps), things quickly take a turn for the worse. Angel needs \n\nmuch more than a simple life coach. What may be simple to grasp for \n\nsome is the idea that single actions in the past comprise tidal waves \n\nof reactions in the present. Director Philippe Caland's REPENTANCE \n\nexamines these issues against a backdrop of kidnapping and murder. \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/rg/VIDEO_PLAY/LINK//video/imdb/vi2837489689/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/rg/VIDEO_PLAY/LINK//video/imdb/vi2837489689/&lt;/a&gt;\n\ngreets to all the greats\n\napologies thought the last one was a full here is the complete one i have\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0168866bbb14b9fae5b9e2848b5976e6ccfe5d8","amp;dn":"REPENTANCE+%28cam%7Brepack%7D%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0168866bbb14b9fae5b9e2848b5976e6ccfe5d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,22,136,102,187,177,75,159,174,91,158,40,72,181,151,110,108,207,229,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
