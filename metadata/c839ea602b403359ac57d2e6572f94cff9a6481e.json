Time to start\na revolution - will it be to liberate the masses or to become their new\noppressor ?\nStarting with a single loyal supporter create a powerful nationwide\nfaction strong enough to oust the President and take control. Using either\nyour Influence, Wealth and Force, gain the allegiance of prominent public\nfigures including members of the Secret Police, Councillors, Celebrities,\nPriests, and Criminals. Hundreds of diverse actions enable you to order\nand manipulate the masses from rallies and riots to constructing crime\nsyndicates, holding charity galas, organising secret police 'hits' or\nbroadcasting news propaganda.
