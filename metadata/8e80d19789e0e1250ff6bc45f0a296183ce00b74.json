The first half of the book covers the great natural hydrogen processes in biology, chemistry, and physics, showing that hydrogen is a trend that can unite all natural sciences. The second half of the book is devoted to the technological hydrogen processes that are under research and development with the aim to create the infrastructure for hydrogen energetics. The book describes the main features of hydrogen that make it inalienable player in processes such as fusion, photosynthesis, and metabolism. It also covers the methods of hydrogen production and storage, highlighting at the same time the exclusive importance of nanotechnologies in those processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e80d19789e0e1250ff6bc45f0a296183ce00b74","amp;dn":"Hydrogen+Energy+for+Beginners+-+Alexander+Gavrilyuk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e80d19789e0e1250ff6bc45f0a296183ce00b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,128,209,151,137,224,225,37,15,246,188,69,240,162,150,24,60,224,11,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
