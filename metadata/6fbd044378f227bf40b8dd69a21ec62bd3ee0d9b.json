It became the first of a series of bloody landmarks that would come to define Stalinism. This revelatory book presentsÃ¢â‚¬â€with analysis and commentaryÃ¢â‚¬â€the most important primary Soviet documents dealing with the brutal economic and cultural subjugation of the Russian peasantry. Drawn from previously unavailable and in many cases unknown archives, these harrowing documents provide the first unimpeded view of the experience of the peasantry during the years 1927-1930.\nThe book, the first of four in the series, covers the background of collectivization, its violent implementation, and the mass peasant revolt that ensued. For its insights into the horrific fate of the Russian peasantry and into StalinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dictatorship, The War Against the Peasantry takes its place an as unparalleled resource.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A monumental and henceforth indispensable guide to the study of collectivization in the USSR.
