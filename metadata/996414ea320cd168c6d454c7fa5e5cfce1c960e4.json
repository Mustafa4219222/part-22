They lived and made this history and much of it is told in their own words.The material contributed by these men of the 101st Airborne Division, the Armor, Tank Destroyer, Army Air Force , and others is tailored meticulously by the author and placed on the historical framework known to most students of the Battle of the Bulge.Pieces of a nearly 60 year old jigsaw puzzle come together in this book, when memoirs related by one soldier fit with those of another unit or group pursuing the battle from another nearby piece of terrain.George Koskimaki is a noted historian of the 101st Airborne Division.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/BATTERED-BASTARDS-BASTOGNE-George-Koskimaki/dp/1612000746&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/BATTERED-BASTARDS-BASTOGNE-George-Koskimaki/dp/1612000746&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:996414ea320cd168c6d454c7fa5e5cfce1c960e4","amp;dn":"The+Battered+Bastards+of+Bastogne%3A+A+Chronicle+of+the+Defense+of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"996414ea320cd168c6d454c7fa5e5cfce1c960e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,100,20,234,50,12,209,104,198,212,84,199,250,94,92,252,225,201,96,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
