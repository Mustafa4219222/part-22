And now, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to discover sex as a weapon. \n\nThe Seattle barista and art student is happy with her beautiful Brit boyfriend, Ben Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially in the bedroom. But while BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her first, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hardly his. And BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sexual history seems to be popping up in TessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face like something out of a zombie movie, and it has her questioning his commitment Ã¢â‚¬â€ and questioning whether his appealing alpha maleness is just a cover for a controlling personality. \n\nMaybe one thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meant to keep her from asking too many questions.\n\nIs Ben the problem, or is everybody from his past the problem? \n\nTess is asking the questions, and pushing hard for answers.\n\nIs Nicole, the ex-fiancÃƒÂ© who cheated on Ben, trying to worm her way back into his life? Was there something between Ben and TessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend, Erin? Or whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going on with BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adored teenage sister, Caroline, and BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best friend Dan? And how did Ben get Tess a job interview with Mr. Andrews, his sophisticated but slimy boss at the music magazine? \n\nAs Tess comes to learn, relationships Ã¢â‚¬â€ especially sexual ones Ã¢â‚¬â€ are as much about power as love. With each new discovery, she finds herself in a struggle to hold her head together as much as her heart. \n\nAnd to find where her own power lies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3eb211508cec76e9bd642118f204af1c9b88823","amp;dn":"Private+Show+%28Private+%232%29+by+Danielle+Torella+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3eb211508cec76e9bd642118f204af1c9b88823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,235,33,21,8,206,199,110,155,214,66,17,143,32,74,241,201,184,136,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
