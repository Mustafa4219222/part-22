Compared to the unfocused general subject matter of most of the band's peers, songs like &quot;Jigsaw Feeling,&quot; &quot;Suburban Relapse,&quot; and especially the barbed contempt of &quot;Mirage&quot; are perfect miniature portraits. \nJohn McKay's metallic (but not metal) guitar parts, riffs that never quite resolve into conventional melodies, and the throbbing Steven Severin/Kenny Morris rhythm section distill the Velvet Underground's early propulsion into a crisper punch with more than a hint of glam's tribal rumble. \nThe sheer variety on the album alone is impressive -- &quot;Overground&quot; and its slow-rising build, carefully emphasizing space in between McKay's notes as much as the notes themselves, the death-march Teutonic stomp of &quot;Metal Postcard,&quot; the sudden near-sunniness of the music (down to the handclaps!) toward the end of &quot;Carcass.&quot; The cover of &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; makes for an unexpected nod to the past -- if it's not as completely overdriven as the original, Siouxsie puts her own definite stamp on it and its sudden conclusion is a great moment of drama. \nIt's the concluding &quot;Switch&quot; that fully demonstrates just how solid the band was then, with McKay's saxophone adding just enough of a droning wild card to the multi-part theatricality of the piece, Siouxsie in particularly fine voice on top of it all.
