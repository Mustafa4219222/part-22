Very small file size,\n\nSummary:\nIn the fantastical aeropolis of Neo Verona, the noble house of Capulet had ruled peacefully for generations - until fourteen years ago, when the ancient grudge held by the rival house of Montague led to a mutiny, and the Capulets were deposed and all wiped out in a bloody coup. Now, as Neo Verona suffers under the thrall of its new masters, the fates of two star crossed lovers are about to become tragically entwined... As the citizens of the city suffer, the Capulet clan struggles to strike a blow against their enemies, and the Montagues tighten their grasp on power, an unlikely love blossoms between Romeo and Juliet - but in the face of such adversity, this ill-fated love may be doomed from the outset. Triumph or tragedy; only fate knows what awaits Romeo and Juliet...\n\nEnjoy, and please seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90b043825e401a63d08ac6577de6d7ecdc092f3b","amp;dn":"Romeo+x+Juliet+Manga+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90b043825e401a63d08ac6577de6d7ecdc092f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,176,67,130,94,64,26,99,208,138,198,87,125,230,215,236,220,9,47,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
