But just two weeks later, her mother died in a freak accident, and life as she knew it was completely over. With her father heading to California for a new job, they decide that Calla should spend a few weeks with the grandmother she barely knows while he gets them set up.\n\nTo Calla's shock, her mother's hometown of Lily Dale is a town full of psychics-including her grandmother. Suddenly, the fact that her mother never talked about her past takes on more mysterious overtones. The longer she stays in town, the stranger things become, as Calla starts to experience unusual and unsettling events that lead her to wonder whether she has inherited her grandmother's unique gift. Is it this gift that is making her suspect that her mother's death was more than an accident, or is it just an overactive imagination? Staying in Lily Dale is the only way to uncover the truth. But will Calla be able to deal with what she learns about her mother's past and her own future?\n\nLook out for the other books in the Lily Dale series: Believing and Connecting!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75b63a5dcee3db3d2935c534a365ab2095a93cc9","amp;dn":"Wendy+Corsi+Staub-Lily+Dale+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75b63a5dcee3db3d2935c534a365ab2095a93cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,182,58,93,206,227,219,61,41,53,197,52,163,101,171,32,149,169,60,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
