Kick Some!\n\nLife on the road is filled with obstacles. Do you have the juice to go from gearjammer to boss man in the trucking business? Climb in the can and find out!\n\nYou're steering the whole operation, from choosing the trucks to hiring the drivers in your fleet. Avoid the hazards and you'll be hauling it in. But, make too many wrong turns along the way and it could be a lost cause.\n\nThat fire in your belly is gonna take you straight to the top. Take risks, cash in and upgrade your rig. Work hard and you might end up driving the whole show! \n\n...................................................................................\n\nHaulin' takes the series back to its truck simulation roots. With a much higher emphasis on the trucking business side of the game, the player's driving skills as well as business instincts are constantly challenged. \n\n\nMinimum system requirements:\n\n  *  Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\n  *  Pentium 4 1.4 Ghz or 100% compatible\n  *  256 MB RAM\n  *  540 MB HD Space\n  *  64 MB DirectX/Direct3D and T&amp;L compatible video accelerator card\n  *  DirectX 9.0c or later\n  *  DirectX compatible sound card\n  *  Mouse","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f98686ac04ee51a9c83fab3a1c8948a7253afd9","amp;dn":"18+Wheels+of+Steel+Haulin%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f98686ac04ee51a9c83fab3a1c8948a7253afd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,152,104,106,192,78,229,26,156,131,250,179,161,200,148,138,114,83,175,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
