Produced by the legendary Joe Gibbs, the recording is an organic-sounding player's album. The eight lengthy songs open up into supple, soulful grooves, with guitars--one played by Brown, unlike on his dancehall albums--and percussion adding to the thick rhythms powered by Robbie Shakespeare's thundering yet melodic bass. \r\n\r\nHorns, organ and electric piano add to the sound, making LOVE LIGHT sound almost like one of Brown's mid-1970s classics. &quot;A Little Bit More&quot; and a stunning reworking of Leadbelly's &quot;Little Village,&quot; one of Brown's most inspired covers, are the highlights. Overall, this is one of Brown's strongest efforts of the 1990s. \r\n\r\n\r\n1 - A Little Bit More\r\n\r\n2 - Tribulation\r\n\r\n3 - Rocking Time\r\n\r\n4 - Caress Me Girl\r\n\r\n5 - Love Light\r\n\r\n6 - Hold On To What You've Got\r\n\r\n7 - Little Village\r\n\r\n8 - Have You Ever Been In Love\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoyy and Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f28afbc9f10e839efc2fc7a0079a5d81200c2830","amp;dn":"Dennis+Brown+-+Love+Light","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f28afbc9f10e839efc2fc7a0079a5d81200c2830","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,138,251,201,241,14,131,158,252,47,199,160,7,154,93,129,32,12,40,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
