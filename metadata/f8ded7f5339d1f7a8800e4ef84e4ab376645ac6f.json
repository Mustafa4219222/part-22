Written by Polly Samson.\n\nA collection of short stories, each linked to the others by themes of imperfection, compromise and the joy of accepting life as it is.\n\nThe Egg (read by Claire Skinner)\n\nCelia's life is perfect; husband, children, beautiful house by the sea. But it can take just one thing to turn a life upside down.\n\nBarcarolle (read by Mark Meadows)\n\nJust as a piano tuner might once have been a concert pianist, so a broken-backed upright can be the piano of someone's dreams.\n\nThe Birthday Present (read by Rosie Cavaliero)\n\nShe had nothing to give him for his birthday. But as it turned out, nothing was just perfect.\n\nThe Rose Before the Vine (read by Claire Skinner)\n\nRose and her daughter Anna have a long history of disappointing each other; and just as Anna seems to have turned a corner in her life, Rose has to give her some devastating news.\n\nRemote Control (read by Rosie Cavaliero)\n\nUpstairs, two lovely little boys tucked up in bed; downstairs, a man and his television versus a woman and her cat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8ded7f5339d1f7a8800e4ef84e4ab376645ac6f","amp;dn":"Polly+Samson+-+Perfect+Lives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8ded7f5339d1f7a8800e4ef84e4ab376645ac6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,222,215,245,51,157,31,122,136,0,228,239,132,228,171,55,102,69,172,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
