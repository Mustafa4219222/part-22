After failing to break through 1980s Brazilian Pop rock she went to semi-exile in Italy where she met the famous producer Nelson Motta (soon her boyfriend). Thereafter she became a hybrid of MPB diva and Pop rock performer. While most of her music is in the style of modern MPB, she has also recorded traditional samba and folk tunes, as well and songs performed by Marvin Gaye, Lou Reed and George Harrison. Much of her work has been in collaboration with musicians/songwriters Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes, and Nando Reis, and producer Arto Lindsay. She has also worked with foreign artists such as Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Julieta Venegas. Marisa Monte is unique as a Brazilian artist due to the fact that she owns the rights to all of her songs; it was the main demand to renew her contract with EMI Music.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:377843222c928acb3078198e2374d27cd59789bf","amp;dn":"Marisa+Monte+-+Infinito+ao+Meu+Redor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"377843222c928acb3078198e2374d27cd59789bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,120,67,34,44,146,138,203,48,120,25,142,35,116,210,124,213,151,137,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
