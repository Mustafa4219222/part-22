Extract the two 7z archives (containing the iso, and the patch) to desired\n   directory on your hard drive (for example, your desktop).\n \n2. Use a virtual CD/DVD emulator program such as Daemon Tools to mount the ISO\n   image as a virtual CD.\n\n3. Install the game from the virtual CD you just mounted.\n\n4. When the game is installed, patch the game using the patch provided.\n\n5. PLAY!\n\nMaking your own maps:\n---------------------\nIf you feel like creating your own maps, just launch the Unreal Editor 2.0. It\\'s really easy to learn, Wolf has a great guide: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://unreal.gamedesign.net/tutorials/ued.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://unreal.gamedesign.net/tutorials/ued.shtml&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHave fun playing the game, and enjoy the stunning graphics!\n\n(Best played on a computer with Pentium MMX 266MHz,  with two 3DFX Voodoo 2 cards). ;)\n\n\n\n//DarkVio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb601baec6e4690fad976db16f34b50fd041853","amp;dn":"Unreal+I+%281998%29+by+DarkVio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb601baec6e4690fad976db16f34b50fd041853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,182,1,186,236,110,70,144,250,217,118,219,22,243,75,80,253,4,24,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
