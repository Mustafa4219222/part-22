There are travel tips and tricks sprinkled throughout the book that we could all benefit from - tips on choosing street food, being sensitive to sacred cows in Hindu cultures, and which hand to eat with as to not insult your host in India (use your right hand!).\n\nThere are a few photographs printed in the book, courtesy of The Travel Channel. Even though some of the more bizarre foods made me squeamish, we all wished there were more pictures throughout the book, instead of only in the middle.\n\nThis was a great book of Bizarre Food for the whole family! The best part? We ALL learned a few things!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b99714306f0668e6738fa76942b39ac5838d41e","amp;dn":"Andrew+Zimmern%5C%27s+Bizarre+World+of+Food+Brains%2C+Bugs%2C+and+Blood+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b99714306f0668e6738fa76942b39ac5838d41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,153,113,67,6,240,102,142,103,56,250,118,148,43,57,172,88,56,212,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
