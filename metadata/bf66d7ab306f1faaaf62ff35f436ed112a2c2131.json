Having already headlined with Cream, Zappa, Neil Young and The Byrds, this now relatively unknown band were scheduled to play the Hollywood Bowl with The Young Rascals and Janis Joplin.\n\nIn a cruel twist of fate their equipment was stolen twice by the mob, and the group disbanded to be left wondering what might have been. But for these misfortunes Hunger might have amounted to more than just a record collectorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relic.\n\nHailing from Portland Oregon, The Hunger! had moved down to Los Angeles in the late sixties where they began to gain popularity amongst the burgeoning West Coast psychedelic scene.\n\nTheir sole album, Strictly From Hunger! was released on Public! Records in 1968 and is very much in keeping with the more prominent psych-rock bands of the Californian scene, inhabiting the same musical sphere as The Strawberry Alarm Clock, The Doors and Jefferson Airplane. All of the tracks are predominately organ lead with an emphasis on a heavy Ã¢â‚¬Å“swinging sixtiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ groove, orchestrated by some fantastic bass work by Tom Tanory and the rock steady drumming of Bill Daffern.\n\nThat is not saying, however, that the album is cast in the mould of sunshine/flower pop. Strictly From Hunger! certainly has itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darker and heavier moments and there is an inescapable feeling of melancholy throughout the course of the record. The vocals (Parkinson, Daffern and Morton all take turns on various tracks) move between paranoia and despondency, highlighting the subtly surreal lyrics with minor melodies punctuated by the odd frenetic fuzz-guitar solo.\n\nby  Gerard Fannon\n\nTracklist:\n\n \n1A \tColors \t                  3:35\n2A \tPortland 69 \t          5:38\n3A \tThe Truth \t          5:31\n4A \tNo Shame \t          2:25\n5A \tOpen Your Eyes \t          3:55\n1B \tTrying To Make The Best   7:35\n2B \tWorkshop \t          7:15\n3B \tMind Machine \t          4:01\n4B \tShe Let Him Continue \t  5:02","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf66d7ab306f1faaaf62ff35f436ed112a2c2131","amp;dn":"Hunger-+Strictly+From+Hunger","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf66d7ab306f1faaaf62ff35f436ed112a2c2131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,102,215,171,48,111,31,170,175,98,255,53,244,54,237,17,42,44,33,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
