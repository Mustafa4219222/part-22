Roy and Dave sing us into some ideas from Daveâ€™s dad, we hear about a possible Star Wars episode, thereâ€™s some controversy revolving around Stevie, and the Irish Cobra comes out to spit his venom. We hear from Shock Jock Robot, Flutesy plays a song, we find out Roy is Anti-American, and damn, itâ€™s been a real fine day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e03b6a57f2cc600429043b150607d4a0a216dc16","amp;dn":"East+Side+Dave+Show+2016-09-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e03b6a57f2cc600429043b150607d4a0a216dc16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,59,106,87,242,204,96,4,41,4,59,21,6,7,212,160,162,22,220,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
