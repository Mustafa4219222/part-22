In creating a sequel to Cinematic Guitars, the designers at Sample Logic, and Steve Ouimette (Composer/Artist/Producer) went all the way back to the fundamentals of the recording process, where they re-conceived and invented new and clever ways of creating and capturing unique sounds derived entirely from real guitars, a big part of which came from the destruction and mutilation of real guitars during the recording process.  From guitars being chained up, drilled, shattered, sledge hammered, and set on fire to the elegance and pristine air of bowed and prepared guitars, all off which were carefully manipulated and morphed to craft a library that sounds like no other.\n\nRemember If you like it, buy it!
