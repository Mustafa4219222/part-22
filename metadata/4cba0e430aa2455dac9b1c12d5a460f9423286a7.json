The album has sold over 9,000,000 copies worldwide. Issues are one thing Korn singer Jonathan Davis has in spades. On the quintet's fourth album, Davis spews forth about misery, hate, happiness, pain, paranoia, and other primal issues, all set to an appropriately dark soundtrack. From &quot;Dead&quot; (which begins with Davis's trademark bagpipes in a sort of choral musical setting), to the first single, &quot;Falling Away from Me,&quot; the vocalist's quavery, edgy, manic delivery sets the tone for this 16-song outing. Not as modern sounding or melodic as 1998's Follow the Leader, Issues is a throwback to earlier, more metallic Korn. If possible, Issues has an even creepier vibe than its three predecessors, thanks partially to eerie guitar lines and vocal effects, especially potent on &quot;Let's Get This Party Started.&quot; Twisted, cohesive, and epic, Issues comes through for Korn's fans, who relate to the band's cathartic musical exorcisms and aggro, bottom-heavy rage, commercialism be damned. \n(Please note: You may receive any one of the album's four different covers.)\n\n\n* * * * * The song &quot;Dirty&quot; ends at 3:43 and is followed up by 4 minutes and 7 seconds of static.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Dead \t\t\t- [01:14] \n[02] Falling Away From Me \t\t- [04:30] \n[03] Trash \t\t\t- [03:26]\n[04] 4U \t\t\t\t- [01:42] \n[05] Beg For Me \t\t\t- [03:53] \n[06] Make Me Bad \t\t\t- [03:55]\n[07] It's Gonna Go Away \t\t- [01:30] \n[08] Wake Up \t\t\t- [04:07] \n[09] Am I Going Crazy \t\t- [00:59] \n[01] Hey Daddy \t\t\t- [03:44] \n[11] Somebody Someone \t\t- [03:47]\n[12] No Way \t\t\t- [04:07] \n[13] Let's Get This Party Started\t- [03:41] \n[14] Wish You Could Be Me   \t- [01:07] \n[15] Counting \t\t\t- [03:38] \n[16] Dirty \t\t\t- [07:50]\n \n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t---&gt; 00h:51m:57s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t---&gt; 130mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t---&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t---&gt; I- Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t---&gt; N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Metal Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t---&gt; 16 November 1999\n\nRecord Company\t\t---&gt; Sony Music\n\nArtist Website\t\t---&gt; http://modlife.com/korn \n\t\t\t---&gt;\n\t\t\t---&gt; http://modlife.com/korn/twitter \n\t\t\t---&gt;\n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.bebo.com/korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/k/korn.html \n\t\t\t---&gt;\n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/korn \n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cba0e430aa2455dac9b1c12d5a460f9423286a7","amp;dn":"%5B1999%5D+Issues+-+Korn+-+130mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cba0e430aa2455dac9b1c12d5a460f9423286a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,186,14,67,10,162,69,93,172,155,28,18,213,164,96,249,66,50,134,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
