Screened in competition at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival last year, the movie is one of the most realistic accounts of the infamous abduction. It stars Isabelle Huppert, award-winning French actress who, with her repertoire of having done more than 90 films, was given the task to successfully portray the kind of grittiness that Mendoza wanted to depict. Ã¢â‚¬Å“CaptiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tells the story of French missionary Therese Bourgoine (Huppert), a volunteer for a humanitarian nongovernment organization in Palawan. While in Puerto Princesa, she, along with her local guide Soledad (Carpio) and 20 other tourists, are thrown off their actual mission in a rebel ambush when they are abducted and brought into captivity by militant group Abu Sayyaf. Identified by critics as the most truthful cinematic treatment of a real story that shook the lives of many, Mendoza realistically depicts the brutality of hostage situations and the violent armed conflict in Muslim Mindanao.\n\n\nLanguages: Tagalog / English / French\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English\n\nNo hard subs, no dubs.
