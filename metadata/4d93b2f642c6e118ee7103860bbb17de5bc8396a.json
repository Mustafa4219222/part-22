Produced by George Martin, Rubber Soul had been recorded in just over four weeks to make the Christmas market. Unlike the five albums that preceded it, Rubber Soul was the first Beatles album recorded during a specific period, the sessions not dashed off in between either tour dates or during filming projects.[1] After this, every Beatles album would be made without the need to pay attention to other commitments, except for the production of short promotional films or principal photography and editing to Magical Mystery Tour. The album was described as a major artistic achievement, attaining widespread critical and commercial success, with reviewers taking note of the Beatles\\' developing musical vision.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d93b2f642c6e118ee7103860bbb17de5bc8396a","amp;dn":"6%2F14+Rubber+Soul+%282009+Stereo+Remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d93b2f642c6e118ee7103860bbb17de5bc8396a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,147,178,246,66,198,225,24,238,113,3,134,11,187,23,222,91,200,57,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
