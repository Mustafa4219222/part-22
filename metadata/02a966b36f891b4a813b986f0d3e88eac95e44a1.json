Earlier in the year, viewers had the chance to vote for their favourite moment from 50 nominations brought together by a distinguished panel of Corrie experts, including the show's creator Tony Warren and original cast member William Roache. Now the results are being revealed, and the programme will reveal the stories behind the clips - from the high emotion of teen mum Sarah-Louise Platt to the hilarity of Ken Barlow trying to teach French to Raquel Wolstenhulme and the national Free The Weatherfield One campaign. Featuring archive clips and interviews with the stars, writers, producers and directors who helped bring the show to the screen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02a966b36f891b4a813b986f0d3e88eac95e44a1","amp;dn":"Coronation+Street+50+Years%2C+50+Moments+-+Part+One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02a966b36f891b4a813b986f0d3e88eac95e44a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,169,102,179,111,137,27,74,129,59,152,111,13,62,136,234,201,94,68,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
