It featured a 19+ minute side long track called What Love (Suite). Most side long tracks from this time period were jams. What Love is different. It is a structured, written piece with multiple tempo changes from Victorian chants to all out frenzied mayhem. A strong album throughout. Not a weak track on it.   \n\nTrack List:\n01. What Is Love\n02. She (Will-O-The-Wind)\n03. Howard Christman's Older\n04. Lynda Purple\n05. One Act Play\n06. What Love (Suite)\n\nBiography by Stansted Montfichet\nOriginally formed in 1964 as the Classics (adopting the name CFUN Classics when they gigged to promote local Vancouver, BC radio station CFUN-AM), the group were featured as the house band on Let's Go, a weekly TV show. In 1965, they released two singles as the Canadian Classics -- &quot;Til I Met You&quot; (Jaguar 2002A) and &quot;I Don't Know&quot; (Valiant 723). The band reinvented themselves as the Collectors in 1966. With former horn player Howie Vickers handling lead vocals, they cut &quot;Eyes&quot; and &quot;Don't Feel Bad&quot; -- both of which later appeared on the History of Vancouver Rock and Roll, Volume 4 (VRCA 004; 1991.) &quot;Eyes&quot; -- a fine folk tune seasoned with tasty guitar and just a dash of psychedelia -- is easily the better track. &quot;Don't Feel Bad&quot; has a vague &quot;On Broadway&quot; feel. More elaborately produced, it also seems a less genuine effort. By 1967, in addition to lead singer Howie Vickers, the Collectors included Claire Lawrence (tenor sax, organ, recorder, flute), Bill Henderson (lead guitar), Glenn Miller (bass) and Ross Turney (drums) -- the band's &quot;classic&quot; line-up. Recordings from this period include the Vancouver smash hit &quot;Lookin' at a Baby&quot; (New Syndrome 16, 1967, subsequently reissued on the History of Vancouver Rock, Volume 3 VRCA 001, 1983) and two other 45s, &quot;Fisherwoman&quot; and &quot;Fat Bird.&quot; &quot;Lookin' at a Baby&quot; is MOR flute-pop floating amidst heady clouds of psychedelia. Vickers' departure from the Collectors in 1969 necessitated Henderson's promotion to lead vocalist. Eventually, the band rechristened themselves Chilliwack.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67bfa989d1feeb848580a7ebdd26dd60b6a56ecf","amp;dn":"The+Collectors+-+S%2FT+psychedelic+masterpiece+from+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67bfa989d1feeb848580a7ebdd26dd60b6a56ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,191,169,137,209,254,235,132,133,128,167,235,221,38,221,96,182,165,110,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
