This film examines the impact of these sensational discoveries.\n\nHistorians have long known about Kush, but relegated its importance to a vassal state of Egypt, significant only for its gold reserves. Early excavations in the Kush capital at Kerma suffered from the innate racism of the archaeologists. Fabulous grave goods, discovered in the 20th century, were thought to have belonged to Kush?s Egyptian overlords. They didn?t consider that a black African culture could have challenged Egypt?s supremacy.\n\nThe inscription exposed the truth. Although it won battles, Kush eventually lost the war, and for the next 1000 years, Egypt had the upper hand. But the inscription served as a warning prophecy to Egypt that it might pay a high price. The enslaved Kushites would have their revenge. Allowed, and even encouraged, to rebuild their own kingdom along the lines of Egypt, in 747 BC, Kush attacked the Pharaoh?s power in a daring land grab.\n\nThe Kushite king, Piye, overthrew the yoke, conquered mighty Egypt and established a 100-year rule of black Pharaohs. Even after being ousted from the Egyptian throne, Kushite kings continued to rule an empire as mighty as any, until the arrival of Alexander the Great. For a number of years, British Museum archaeologists have been making find after find in the Upper Nile Valley to substantiate this story - huge lost pyramids, burial chambers of 200 workers, and stores of gold.\n\n\n\nRelated Documentaries\nAncient Egypt\nBuilding the Great Pyramid\nAncient Voices\nAncient Graves: Voices of the Dead\nThe Lost Mummy of Imhotep\nUnwrapped: The Mysterious World of Mummies\nThe Hidden History of Egypt\nThe Great Egyptians\nThe Face of Tutankhamun\nSecrets of Egypt&amp;#039;s Lost Queen\nRoyal Mummy\nNile: River of Gods\nPyramids of Death\nPyramids\nMystery of the Nile\nNefertiti and the Lost Dynasty\nNefertiti Resurrected\nMysteries of the Nile\nMysteries of Egypt\nNapoleons Obsession: The Quest for Egypt\nMagical Egypt - A Symbolist Tour\nMummies and the Wonders of Ancient Egypt\nJourney Through the Valley of the Kings\nEgypt: Quest for Eternity\nEgypt - Beyond the Pyramids\nTutankhamuns Fireball\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 2021 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 688 x 384\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:48\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n\nRelease Notes\nCouple of glitches\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a97a5ef8faf1361f92e5560ec757b23b8f8270","amp;dn":"BBC+Timewatch+The+Black+Pharaohs+DVB+Xvid+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a97a5ef8faf1361f92e5560ec757b23b8f8270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,169,122,94,248,250,241,54,31,146,229,86,14,199,87,178,59,143,130,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
