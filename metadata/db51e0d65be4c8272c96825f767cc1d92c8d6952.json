Growing up, Rodney becomes infatuated by famous robotics inventor Big Weld, and decides that he wants to be an inventor and work for Big Weld industries one day.\n\nRodney spends his youth and teenage years trying to perfect his own helper robot. He attempts to show his Dad that the robot can help him wash dishes, but helper ends up causing more damage than help.\n\nDetermined to make something of himself and pay off the damages the helper bot caused, Rodney decides to head to Robot City to fulfill his dream and work for Big Weld Industries.\n\nUpon reaching Robot City, Rodney finds the gates to Big Weld Industries shut, with no new ideas coming in. The company, now led by a robot named Ratchet, has also scrapped the business model of supplying spare parts for older robot models, and going with pricier upgrades for robots, with a new slogan titled, &quot;Why be you, when you can be new.&quot;\n\nAfter being kicked out of Big Weld Industries, Rodney finds himself in a darker side of town, where a strange robot named Fender attempts to make off with his foot. Rodney chases after him, and finds a small collective of older robots scrounging for spare parts. In the ensuing chaos, Fender loses a part for his neck, and when the group goes to find a replacement part, finds this item has been discontinued. Even though Fender attempted to cannibalize him, Rodney helps Fender and manages to make a suitable neck replacement out of additional spare parts.\n\nFender's sister, Piper, explains that many robots in Robot City are in desperate need of spare parts that Big Weld Industries used to make. However, in recent months, Big Weld has disappeared; the streets are now patrolled by motorized vehicles, known as Sweepers, that take obsolete models to a dark side of town known as the Chop Shop, run by Madam Gasket (Ratchet's mother). Any collected models never come back.\n\nRodney bunks with the group and another robot named Aunt Fanny, but is surprised the next day when the local parts shop closes its doors, claiming that all spare parts orders from Big Weld Industries have officially dried up. All sorts of robot citizens are up in arms, but Rodney comes forward, and using what spare parts are left, helps those less fortunate.\n\nSoon, the parts loss is felt at home, as Rodney receives a letter from his parents, saying that without spare parts, his father will not survive. Word soon reaches Rodney about an annual company ball held by Big Weld Industries. Rodney and Fender break into the festivities in hopes to talk to Big Weld and convince him to help, since Big Weld always attends this function.\n\nHowever, Ratchet appears claiming that Big Weld couldn't attend. Rodney then comes forward, demanding to know where Big Weld is, and brings to the company's attention the plight of the average bot, of whom Rodney has spent several days trying to repair countless numbers of.\n\nRatchet orders Rodney be captured, but he, Fender, and a female employee named Cappy manage to escape the party. Fender parts ways with the group, while Rodney and Cappy head to Big Weld's mansion to investigate. Rodney is at first excited to meet his childhood hero, but soon grows disillusioned when Big Weld tells him to give up his fight to fix the outmoded robots. Big Weld claims that in the face of change for Big Weld Industries, Ratchet took over, turning the company into an entity that was more about profits than helping others.\n\nRodney then heads to the train station intent on going home, when the other robots and Fender appear. Fender, having just survived almost being destroyed in the Chop Shop, has overheard of the Sweepers being deployed in full force the next day by Madame Gasket and Ratchet to collect all the outmoded robots in Robot City.\n\nBig Weld also shows up, and inspires the group not to give up; they all return to Big Weld Industries to confront Ratchet; Big Weld (inspired by the bots still believing in him) fires Ratchet, who weeps and begs for another chance; caught off-guard, Big Weld succumbs to a knockout punch from Ratchet, who then realizes he's become as crazy as his own mother!\n\nSecurity arrives to remove Big Weld just as Rodney and Cappy turn up; between them they help Big Weld escape the building and end up being chased across Robot City, eventually ending up outside Madam Gasket's Chop Shop (although Big Weld goes shooting through the gates to the inside).\n\nThe group all tool up and enter the Chop Shop to rescue Big Weld from a certain melting down, but are faced with Madam Gasket, Ratchet and the army of new-fangled Sweepers. Piper turns up with all of the city's outmoded robots; working together, they attack Madam Gasket's outfit and rescue Big Weld. Madam Gasket gets melted down and Ratchet gets strung up in chains (next to his poor hen-pecked father) simultaneously losing his flashy upgrades! Big Weld, Piper, Fender and the others all celebrate a victory.\n\nRodney returns home (with Big Weld) and brings enough spare parts for his ailing parents; Rodney has been made Big Weld's right-hand bot, and eventual successor! \n\nPaula Abdul  Paula Abdul   ...  \nWatch (voice) \n \nHalle Berry  Halle Berry   ...  \nCappy (voice) \n \nLucille Bliss  Lucille Bliss   ...  \nPigeon Lady (voice) \n \nTerry Bradshaw  Terry Bradshaw   ...  \nBroken Arm Bot (voice) \n \nJim Broadbent  Jim Broadbent   ...  \nMadame Gasket (voice) \n \nMel Brooks  Mel Brooks   ...  \nBigweld (voice) \n \nAmanda Bynes  Amanda Bynes   ...  \nPiper (voice) \n \nDrew Carey  Drew Carey   ...  \nCrank (voice) \n \nJennifer Coolidge  Jennifer Coolidge   ...  \nAunt Fanny (voice) \n \nDylan Denton  Dylan Denton   ...  \nYoungest Rodney (voice) \n \nWill Denton  Will Denton   ...  \nYoung Rodney (voice) \n \nMarshall Efron  Marshall Efron   ...  \nLamppost / Toilet Bot / Bass Drum / Microphone (voice) \n \nDamien Fahey  Damien Fahey   ...  \nStage Announcer (voice) \n \nLowell Ganz  Lowell Ganz   ...  \nMr. Gasket (voice) \n \nPaul Giamatti  Paul Giamatti   ...  \nTim the Gate Guard (voice)  \n\n\nSex &amp; Nudity \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nDespite the PG rating, the film got away with a lot of innuendo.\n\nHerb's wife says that &quot;making a baby's the fun part&quot; and we then see that they've received a &quot;build a baby&quot; box from which they're going to construct their child. As they do so, we see the baby's bare bottom piece (a hunk of plastic or metal shaped like buttocks), the mother comments on 12 hours of labor, and then wonders about a leftover piece on the floor (that we don't see). Herb then asks, &quot;We did want a boy, right?&quot; and then picks up the piece, tells the robotic baby it's not going to hurt and apparently slaps his unseen baby boy part onto the small robot's crotch area.\n\nWhilst panning across, a female robot on the phone states that she prefers a Brazilian wax, and that &quot;it makes every day feel like a fiesta&quot;. This is obviously put in as a little joke - most people old enough will know what an actual 'Brazilian' is!\n\nIn the middle of the movie, Fender loses his bottom half. He puts another bottom half on, but it's a dress. He continuously uses it for innuendo, like saying &quot;I came all this way in cha-cha heels!&quot;. Later, he dances to a Britney Spears song in her style with the skirt still on.\n\nWhen Bigweld comes back to his office one of the robots stumbles into the woman's room. On the outside of the door it had an outlet and on the mens' room it has it had a plug. This may refer to anatomical parts.\n\nWhen Rodney says he's going to fix people a dog covers his crotch and whimpers. \n\n\n\n\nViolence &amp; Gore \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nA little, flying robot that Rodney has built goes out of control and accidentally breaks things as it flys above a room. Later, it does the same thing in the restaurant where Herb works, accidentally breaking dishes and more.\n\nThere is also a scene where Ratchet maniacly strikes Bigweld over the head with a telephone headset knocking him unconscious.\n\nFender is nearly destroyed in Madame Gasket's underground factory. He makes it out alive (allbeit with a different part). \n\n\n\n\nProfanity \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nSome robot-influenced name calling, like &quot;bucket of bolts&quot;. \n\n\n\n\nAlcohol/Drugs/Smoking \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nRodney's dad places metal cigars in a few robots mouths over his excitement of becoming a dad. \n\n\n\n\nFrightening/Intense Scenes \n\n EditHistory \n\n\nYounger kids may worry when Fender suddenly expresses concern (&quot;We're going to crash&quot;) that an enclosed, but open ball he and Rodney are traveling in suddenly falls off a large contraption and plummets downward (but it's just part of their transport routine and Fender says he was just kidding about the worry).\n\nVarious characters are caught between two large vehicles that each sport large magnets that equally pull on all of them as the vehicles race down the &quot;road,&quot; with Rodney trying to unplug Ratchet's magnet from his. The one with the good characters crashes and slides along the floor, with Bigweld sliding into a smelting area (with the door to it then closing). The rest of the characters then have to save him before he's melted down and/or chopped up, but find themselves massively outnumbered by bad robots.but when they get back-up it leads to an intense fight\n\nYoung viewers might be somewhat frightened by the Madame Gasket's Chop Shop scenes, especially the last one. \n\nTechnical Specs\n\nRuntime: 91 min \n\nSound Mix: DTS | Dolby Digital | SDDS | Sonics-DDP (IMAX version) \n\nColor: Color \n\nAspect Ratio: 1.85 : 1 \n\nDetails\n\nCountry: USA \n\nLanguage: English | Italian \n\nRelease Date: 11 March 2005 (USA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db51e0d65be4c8272c96825f767cc1d92c8d6952","amp;dn":"Robots+-+2005+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db51e0d65be4c8272c96825f767cc1d92c8d6952","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,81,224,214,91,228,200,39,44,150,130,95,118,124,193,217,44,141,105,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
