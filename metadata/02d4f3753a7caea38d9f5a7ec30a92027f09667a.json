Written with the critical insight and stylistic mastery readers have come to expect from Riley, this richly textured narrative draws on numerous new and exclusive interviews with Lennon's friends, enemies, confidantes, and associates; lost memoirs written by relatives and friends; as well as previously undiscovered City of Liverpool records. Riley explores Lennon in all of his contradictions: the British art student who universalized an American style, the anarchic rock 'n' roller with the moral spine, the anti-jazz snob who posed naked with his avant-garde lover, and the misogynist who became a househusband. What emerges is the enormous, seductive, and confounding personality that made Lennon a cultural touchstone.\n\nIn Lennon, Riley casts Lennon as a modernist hero in a sweeping epic, dramatizing rock history anew as Lennon himself might have experienced it.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02d4f3753a7caea38d9f5a7ec30a92027f09667a","amp;dn":"Lennon%3A+The+Man%2C+the+Myth%2C+the+Music+%26acirc%3B%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+The+Definitive+Li","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02d4f3753a7caea38d9f5a7ec30a92027f09667a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,212,243,117,58,124,174,163,141,159,90,126,195,10,146,2,127,9,102,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
