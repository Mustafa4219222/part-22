Again. My brotherâ€™s ex should have been off-limits, but she wasnâ€™t. Not when we were teens. Not when I married her. And definitely not now. I thought after I walked away from her in Vegas we were done. I was wrong. This time my brother isnâ€™t getting in the way of what I want. Iâ€™m going to fight for her, fight for us. The girl f*cking loves me, she just doesnâ€™t know it yet. Friends, lovers, enemies, and nowâ€¦ To say our relationship is complicated would be an understatement. Damaged, demanding, a verifiable prick, Mace Hadley is my biggest mistake, but that didnâ€™t stop the former marine from getting back into my panties the night he arrived home. It was supposed to be one last screw you. Except heâ€™s in my face each chance he gets, between my legs at every opportunity. Iâ€™m not sure how long I can fight him when I still havenâ€™t gotten over him. But Iâ€™ll go down swinging. If I give him my heart and he leaves me behind again, itâ€™ll break me. But thatâ€™s not the worst part. Iâ€™m having the cocky f@#ckerâ€™s baby. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n\r\n                          Visit us for more Awesome ebooks             \r\n\r\n                               http://booksdeity.com/\r\n \r\n                         **********************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e86eb7c3237135289b0f77be1ad48dc6c089892","amp;dn":"Cocky+F%40%23ker+by+Misti+Murphy+%7BBooksDeityTEAM%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e86eb7c3237135289b0f77be1ad48dc6c089892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,134,235,124,50,55,19,82,137,176,247,123,225,173,72,220,108,8,152,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
