This is because the data format on burnt DL discs is different than on \npressed discs (burnt = OTP, pressed = PTP). However, we have discovered a \nsoftware hack which allows the PS2 to read even burnt OTP discs resulting in\nworking dual layer backups! Our Toxic firmware for DMS4 chips already includes\nauto-patching functionality which applies our software hack on the fly when\nbooting games on dual layer media. For those without a DMS4, we present the\nToxic Dual Layer Image Patcher! The patcher works by applying our software\nhack to the game image (.iso, .gi etc) before burning. Once the hack has\nbeen applied by our patcher, burn the modified image to dual layer media\nand play! This method will enable anybody with a modchip capable of booting\nDVD9 media to backup and _play_ DVD9 games such as Gran Turismo 4.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e11e38c23729fdf692f3024f9eb534f30da74ce","amp;dn":"Toxic+Dual+Layer+Image+Patcher+v1+0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e11e38c23729fdf692f3024f9eb534f30da74ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,17,227,140,35,114,159,223,105,47,48,36,249,235,83,79,48,218,116,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
