They provide uniformity in design, procurement, fabrication and installation of materials and equipment in Company facilities.\n\nStandard Drawings can be incorporated by engineers and design contractors into project drawing packages for the construction of new facilities, or the modification of existing facilities.  Standard Drawings can also be selected by material and equipment specifiers for attachment to requisitions and purchase orders.  Use of these drawings produce a number of cost-effective benefits, including reduction of drafting time and effort, increase of the use of commonly available materials, and provide assistance to construction contractors and inspectors that handle many similar installations.\n\nIf you are engineer in design or construction, you'll love this package...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:378c3c044198a4ce4e372830437990a999ca0c68","amp;dn":"Engineering%3A+Aramco+Standard+Drawings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"378c3c044198a4ce4e372830437990a999ca0c68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,140,60,4,65,152,164,206,78,55,40,48,67,121,144,169,153,202,12,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
