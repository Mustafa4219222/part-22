It was first released in the United Kingdom on October 22, 1965 through Pye Records (catalog number NPL 18128). The U.S. version of Fairytale was released by Hickory Records (catalog number LPM 127 [monaural] / LPS 127 [stereo]) in November 1965 with a slightly different set of songs. Peter Eden and Geoff Stephens produced the album.\n\n\nFairytale finds Donovan evolving his styles further towards British folk, especially on songs such as &quot;Summer Day Reflection Song&quot; and &quot;Jersey Thursday&quot;. &quot;Sunny Goodge Street&quot; foreshadows the jazzy feel and descriptions of life in urban London that Donovan would continue to explore over the next two years. Like his previous album What's Bin Did and What's Bin Hid, Fairytale primarily features Donovan singing and playing mouth harp and acoustic guitar. Shawn Phillips is playing the extra twelve-string guitar.\n\nFor release in the United States, Hickory Records added a cover of Buffy Sainte-Marie's &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; and removed a cover of Bert Jansch's &quot;Oh Deed I Do&quot;. Donovan's recording of &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; was released in the U.S. as a single the previous September, and was achieving some chart success.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairytale_%28album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairytale_%28album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nOriginal album (UK)\n\n01.
