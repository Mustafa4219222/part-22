The band's constantly shifting line-up was originally augmented by guitarist/backing vocalist Sheron Alton, keyboardist Scott Kreyer, bassist Nick Costello, and drummer Jimmy Fox.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLookin' for Trouble, Toronto's debut album, was released in 1980. Nearly every track on the album was released as a single and the band achieved heavy airplay for &quot;Even The Score&quot;, &quot;Don't Stop Me&quot; and the title track.[2] The U.S. release uses different cover artwork and excludes the final track &quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot;. The album reached Platinum status in Canada, but did not chart in the USA. The original cover art was designed by Hugh Syme and was originally intended to be the cover art for Max Webster's High Class in Borrowed Shoes.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Greatest Hits ia a compilation album by the Canadian Rock band Toronto, released in 1984. Tha album features two new studio tracks: &quot;Andrea&quot; and &quot;Me Generation&quot;. The CD release features the bonus track &quot;What About Love&quot;, as well as music videos for three songs.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nHead On is the second studio album by Canadian rock band Toronto, released in 1981. The album was produced by Terry Brown, best known for his work with Rush.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet It on Credit is the third studio album by Canadian rock band Toronto, released in 1982. Both original members Nick Costello and Jim Fox left the band prior to this release, to be replaced by Gary LaLonde and Barry Connors, respectively. LaLonde later joined Honeymoon Suite, while Connors went on to work with Toronto-based quartet Coney Hatch.\n\nThe CD release features two bonus tracks that did not make the cut for the original album: &quot;What About Love&quot; and &quot;Across the Border&quot;. &quot;What About Love&quot; was later recorded by Heart and would become a Top 10 hit on the Billboard charts.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGirls' Night Out is the fourth studio album by Canadian rock band Toronto, released in 1983. The first U.S. release featured 3-D cover artwork and included red/blue 3-D glasses. More personnel changes on this album, with bassist Gary LaLonde passing the torch to Mike Gingrich. The CD release features one bonus track, &quot;What About Love&quot;.\n\nThe album is dedicated to audio engineer Robbie Whelan, who died in a car accident earlier in the year.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b94360c630237448273a12da1451aacc82e0e145","amp;dn":"Toronto+%5B5+Albums%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D%5BRMSTD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b94360c630237448273a12da1451aacc82e0e145","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,67,96,198,48,35,116,72,39,58,18,218,20,81,170,204,130,224,225,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
