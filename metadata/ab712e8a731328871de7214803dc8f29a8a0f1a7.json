It was the first Gov't Mule album to feature Andy Hess and Danny Louis as permanent members, and it was also the first album that Gov't Mule did not play live before its release. The title is a reference to the fact that the band believes it rocks just like it used to before the death of former bassist Allen Woody.\n\nDeja Voodoo\n\n    &quot;Bad Man Walking&quot; (Haynes, Danny Louis) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n    &quot;About to Rage&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:06\n    &quot;Perfect Shelter&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:51\n    &quot;Little Toy Brain&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:12\n    &quot;Slackjaw Jezebel&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:25\n    &quot;Wine and Blood&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:44\n    &quot;Lola Leave Your Light On&quot; (Haynes, Andy Hess, Jeff Anders) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:20\n    &quot;Silent Scream&quot; (Haynes, Louis) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 10:57\n    &quot;No Celebration&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:32\n    &quot;Mr. Man&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n    &quot;My Separate Reality&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:58\n    &quot;New World Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:58\n\n\nMo' Voodoo [Deja Voodoo - BONUS DISC]\n\n    &quot;King's Highway&quot; (Henry) - 4:54\n    &quot;I'll Be The One&quot; (Haynes) - 6:00\n    &quot;My Oh My&quot; (David Gray/McClune) - 5:07\n    &quot;I Can't Be You&quot; (Haynes) - 4:33\n    &quot;Ballerina&quot; (Van Morrison) - 6:32\n\nDeep Ellum Mule [Deja Voodoo - BONUS DISC]\n\n    &quot;Fools Moon&quot; - 6:03\n    &quot;I Think You Know What I Mean &quot; (Haynes) - 7:20\n    &quot;Trane&quot; - 7:39\n    &quot;Bad Little Doggie&quot; - 4:20\n    &quot;Drums&quot; - 6:79\n    &quot;Nuevo Mulo Jam&quot; - 6:32\n    &quot;No Need To Suffer&quot; - 8:21\n\nLive In Chicago [Deja Voodoo - BONUS DISC]\n\n    &quot;Slackjaw Jezebel&quot; \n    &quot;Thorizine Shuffle&quot; \n    &quot;About To Rage&quot;\n    &quot;Perfect Shelter&quot;\n    &quot;Beautifully Broken&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab712e8a731328871de7214803dc8f29a8a0f1a7","amp;dn":"Deja+Voodoo+-+Mo+Voodoo+-+Deep+Ellum+Mule+-+Live+In+Chicago+%5B320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab712e8a731328871de7214803dc8f29a8a0f1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,113,46,138,115,19,40,135,29,231,33,72,3,220,143,41,168,160,241,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
