Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last surviving crew member of a corporate spaceship destroyed after an attack by a vicious, virtually unbeatable alien life form. Adrift in space for half a century, Ripley grapples with depression until she's informed by her company's representative, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet where her crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. Contact with the colony has suddenly been lost, and a detachment of colonial marines is being sent to investigate. Invited along as an advisor, Ripley predicts disaster, and sure enough, the aliens have infested the colony, leaving a sole survivor, the young girl Newt (Carrie Henn). With the soldiers picked off one by one, a final all-female showdown brews between the alien queen and Ripley, who's become a surrogate mother to Newt. Several future stars made early career appearances in Aliens (1986), including Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Reiser.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio Commentary includes Director James Cameron, Producer Gale Anne Hurd, Alien Effects Creator Stan Winston, Visual Effects Supervisors Robert Skotak and Dennis Skotak, Miniature Effects Supervisor Pat McClung, Actors Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, Carrie Henn, and Christopher Henn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn\r\nDIRECTOR......: James Cameron\r\nWRITERS.......: James Cameron\r\nGENRE.........: Science Fiction | Action | Adventure\r\nRATING........: 8.4/10  481,232 votes\r\nMETASCORE.....: 87\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605\r\nRUNTIME.......: 2h 35mn\r\nSIZE..........: 5.27GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1080\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 1.78:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 4000 Kbps (3 pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO 1.......: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\r\nAUDIO 2.......: Commentary with Cast &amp; Crew\r\nSOURCE........: Aliens.SE.1986.1080p.BD-Remux.3xRus.2xEng.HDv0T\r\nSUBTITLES.....: ENG   \r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-06-04\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreens\r\n \nhttp://postimg.org/gallery/1woff730/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26be303fff0e4d0548a7ee6e5deac4c54e6ced96","amp;dn":"Aliens.Special.Edition.1986.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-SARTRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26be303fff0e4d0548a7ee6e5deac4c54e6ced96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,190,48,63,255,14,77,5,72,167,238,110,93,234,196,197,78,108,237,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
