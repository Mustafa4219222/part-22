It deals with every historical and contemporary aspect of hemp usage and cultivation (mainly in the U.S.), which turns out to be a lot.\n\nFrom describing the production of a fiber much more durable and economic than wood, the documentary discusses hemps multilateral uses as e.g. food products, as a non-polluting fuel and as a pharmaceutical product with much less grievous side-effects than chemical pharmaceutical products.\n\nThe film also investigates why America went from a country which produced vast quantities of the non-narcotic industrial hemp, to the complete ban on hemp production in 1938.\n\nThis story in particular is interesting, and it points out that the large oil-based industries actually had a key role in the aforementioned ban. Food for thought! The conclusion of the documentary could be that hemp may prove to be a valid alternative to both oil and wood in the future.\n\n\nCheck this account for updates regularly :)\n\t\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a677bf3d6e0574aca4685fbc3d9b5767a5fdf0","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+Hemp+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a677bf3d6e0574aca4685fbc3d9b5767a5fdf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,166,119,191,61,110,5,116,172,164,104,95,188,61,155,87,103,165,253,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
