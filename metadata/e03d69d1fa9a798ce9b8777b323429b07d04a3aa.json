Hitherto the sheer diversity of flower seeds, in their form, function and biology, has hindered the production of a comprehensive treatment of the topic. This book provides a unique and much-needed resource of information on the biology and technology of flower seeds. It presents in-depth information on the history and evolution of the ornamental and wild flower seed industries followed by recommendations for successful breed and production programs. A comprehensive coverage of the biology of flower seeds is considered as well as appropriate technologies associated with germination, vigor and viability testing. In this volume, the first of its kind, international authorities from academia and industry have been brought together to provide a comprehensive reference resource for both practitioners and students of seed science and technology and of ornamental horticulture.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e03d69d1fa9a798ce9b8777b323429b07d04a3aa","amp;dn":"Flower+Seeds%3A+Biology+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e03d69d1fa9a798ce9b8777b323429b07d04a3aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,61,105,209,250,154,121,140,233,184,119,123,50,52,41,176,125,4,163,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
