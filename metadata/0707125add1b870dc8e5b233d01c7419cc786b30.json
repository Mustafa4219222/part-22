President Ronald Reagan was embroiled in the Iran-Contra scandal, the stock market experienced its second largest crash ever, Three Men and a Baby was stinking up the screens and Michael Jackson showed that he was truly Bad.\n\nBack before the term &quot;alternative rock&quot; was co-opted in the 90s to describe fairly generic music, in the mid to late-80s it was used for music, often creative and unusual, that was ignored by the mainstream radio and press, particularly Rolling Stone magazine. Independent labels like SST, Twin/Tone, Homestead, Dischord and Touch &amp; Go sprung out of record stores and from artists who wanted to create their own sound from the bottom up.\n\nSimilar movements were happening in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and especially England, but this series is dedicated to the Americans, who tried to create something lasting and sometimes succeeded. Some were influential, some became legendary and some just disappeared.\n-- \n01-Litany (Life Goes On)-Guadalcanal Diary [Atlanta]\n02-Play My Song-Redd Kross [Los Angeles]\n03-Carefree-Dumptruck [Boston]\n04-Kid Dynamite-Squirrel Bait [Louisville]\n05-The Lung-Dinosaur Jr [Amherst]\n06-Other Days And Different Planets-Screaming Trees [Ellensburg]\n07-Outside This Bar-American Music Club [San Francisco]\n08-Bad Penny-Big Black [Chicago]\n09-Not Your Fault-Thin White Rope [Davis]\n10-Faith Healer-Big Dipper [Boston]\n11-When The Girls Get Here-Young Fresh Fellows [Seattle]\n12-(I\\&amp;#039;ve Got a) Catholic Block-Sonic Youth [New York]\n13-Like The Weather-10,000 Maniacs [Jamestown]\n14-Scotty\\&amp;#039;s Lament-The Connells [Raleigh]\n15-My Baby She\\&amp;#039;s All Right-Scruffy The Cat [Boston]\n16-Never Mind-The Replacements [Minneapolis]\n17-Burning Sun-Blood On The Saddle [Los Angeles]\n18-I Want You Bad-The Long Ryders [Los Angeles]\n19-Honey, Please-fIREHOSE [San Pedro]\n20-Confusion Fog-Meat Puppets [Phoenix]\n21-True-Concrete Blonde [Los Angeles]\n22-Chardonnay-Game Theory [Davis]\n23-Letter To A Fanzine-The Great Plains [Columbus]\n24-Tennessee Fire-Silos [New York City]\n25-A Test-The Reivers [Austin]\n26-Exhuming McCarthy-R.E.M [Athens].\n27-Dear Friend-Flying Color [San Francisco]\n28-Lewis-Yo La Tengo [Hoboken]\n29-Happy Nightmare Baby-Opal [Los Angeles]\n30-Christianity Is Stupid-Negativland [San Francisco]\n31-Charity, Chastity, Prudence, And Hope-Husker Du [Minneapolis]\n32-Don\\&amp;#039;t Look Back-The Reactions [Cleveland]\n33-Alive Again-Live Skull [New York]\n34-Let It Rain-The Dream Syndicate [Los Angeles]\n35-Human Cannonball-Butthole Surfers [Austin]\n36-In A Glass House-Antietam [Louisville]\n37-(I Don\\&amp;#039;t Know) What (I\\&amp;#039;m Doing Here)-The Leaving Trains [Los Angeles]\n38-Treepig-Donner Party [San Francisco]\n39-Ride My See-Saw-Bongwater [New York]\n40-Clarkesville-Green On Red [Tucson]\n41-Big Time Operator-The Dead Milkmen [Philadelphia]\n42-Blood &amp; Roses-The Smithereens [Carteret NJ]\n43-Song Of The South-Breaking Circus [Minneapolis]\n44-Working For Somebody Else-The dB\\&amp;#039;s [Winston-Salem]\n45-Girl With The Hair-Das Damen [New York]\n46-Ready To Rock-Pianosaurus [New York]\n47-Golden Gate Park-The Catheads [San Francisco]\n48-U.S. Teens Are Spoiled Bums-Half Japanese [Uniontown MD]\n49-Shiny Golden Snakes-Birdsongs Of The Mesozoic [Boston]\n50-Elvis Is Everywhere-Mojo Nixon &amp; Skid Roper [Chapel Hill]\n-- \nAAC 192KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0707125add1b870dc8e5b233d01c7419cc786b30","amp;dn":"Nuggets+of+American+College+Rock%3A+1987","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0707125add1b870dc8e5b233d01c7419cc786b30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,7,18,90,221,27,135,13,200,229,178,51,208,28,116,25,204,120,107,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
