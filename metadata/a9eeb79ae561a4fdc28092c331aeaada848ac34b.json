Here 2 other sources complete the show, and remove all radio interruptions.  Matching levels on the sources required lowering the levels on the FM sources, and raising the levels on the audience recording (the audience recording levels called for some work, since the crowd clapped throughout some of the songs, and the clapping was *much* louder than most of the music; so I raised the levels of the audience source).\n\nThe interviews from the FM broadcasts are not included; Patti was almost entirely overdubbed (in German and Italian, on Source 1 and 3 respectively).\n\nMany thanks to Vineland for Source 3 (and Source 4 which was not used)!\n\nShare freely, Never Buy or Sell, and please support the artists!\n\ncoyote  3 October 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9eeb79ae561a4fdc28092c331aeaada848ac34b","amp;dn":"Patti+Smith+2003-07-30+complete+Montagnola%2C+Switzerland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9eeb79ae561a4fdc28092c331aeaada848ac34b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,238,183,154,229,97,164,253,194,128,146,195,49,174,170,218,132,138,195,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
