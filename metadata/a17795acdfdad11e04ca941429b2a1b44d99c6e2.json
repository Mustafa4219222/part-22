Eddie Condon played a 4 string guitar as a sort of rhythm \n\ninstrument.\n\n\n\nI've cut out the tedious breakdown takes so the 21 tracks left are all masters\n\nor at least complete takes.  I don't have vol. #2\n\n\n\nWhat I like most about this CD is the bari sax of Ernie Caceres. Edmond Hall \n\nalso takes some great solos on clarinet.\n\n\nThe tune MUSKRAT RAMBLE was probably written about Muscatel wine and the pro-\n\nnunciation got twisted or somebody got drunk and took liberties with it. \n\nCountry Joe McDonald (Country Joe and the Fish) performed famously at Woodstock\n\nthe tune: I FEEL LIKE I'M FIXIN' TO DIE RAG which was MUSKRAT RAMBLE with anti\n\nwar lyrics.  McDonald was sued for copyright infringement by composer/trombonist\n\nKid Ory's daughter but the lawsuit was dismissed for lateness.\n\n\n\nWartime Lyric:  Uncle Sam Aint No Woman, But He Sure Can Take Your Man.....\n\n                 from UNCLE SAM BLUES","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a17795acdfdad11e04ca941429b2a1b44d99c6e2","amp;dn":"Eddie+Condon+All+Stars+Vol%231+%2F+1944+%2F+Stash+Records+1990","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a17795acdfdad11e04ca941429b2a1b44d99c6e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,119,149,172,223,218,209,30,4,202,148,20,41,178,161,180,77,153,198,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
