It is also referred to as the Tethys Sea.\n\n\n------------------------------\n\nTitle:\nVANISHED OCEAN: How Tethys Reshaped the World by Dorrik Stow\n\nDescription:\nSix million years ago, a vast ocean--which scientists have named Tethys--vanished from the face of the earth. Vanished Ocean tells the fascinating story of Tethys, offering an illuminating account of the scientific evidence for the ocean's existence.\n\nWorld-renowned geologist and oceanographer Dorrik Stow describes the powerful forces that shaped the ocean; the marine life it once held and the rich deposits of oil that life left behind; and the impact of its currents on environment and climate.\n\nThe story of Tethys is also a story of extraordinary episodes such as the virtual drying up of the Mediterranean, before being filled again by a dramatic cascade of water over the straits of Gibraltar.\n\nAlong the way, Stow reveals how geologists and oceanographers spent years proving the former existence of Tethys, from a remarkable series of clues locked away in rocks now exposed high up in mountain ranges and buried in sediments deep beneath today's oceans. Indeed, these myriad clues are now scattered from the depths of the Caspian Sea to the highest Himalayan peaks.\n\n------------------------------\n\nReview from Dr. Martin Rundkvist at scienceblogs.com:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I found Vanished Ocean to be a lively, engaging and solidly informative read, which even manages to make deep-ocean sedimentology look pretty exciting. And that is no small achievementÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nNote: All chapter links work fine using Aldiko and Kindle for Android on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model) and Kindle for PC and Calibre for PC for the mobi and epub file respectively.\n\n------------------------------\n\nEnjoy.\n\nPlease support the author if you are able to - Thank you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3e567480c51fa73a3c6b654d1e4c094f9bb201f","amp;dn":"Vanished+Ocean+ebook+Dorrik+Stow+epub+mobi+Non-fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3e567480c51fa73a3c6b654d1e4c094f9bb201f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,229,103,72,12,81,250,115,163,198,182,84,209,228,192,148,249,187,32,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
