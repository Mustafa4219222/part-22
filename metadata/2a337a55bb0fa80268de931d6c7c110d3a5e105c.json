Some of his better known novels include Little Man, What Now? (1932) and Every Man Dies Alone (1947). His works belong predominantly to the New Objectivity literary style, with precise details and journalistic veneration of the facts. Fallada's pseudonym derives from a combination of characters found in the Grimm's Fairy Tales: the protagonist of Hans in Luck (KHM 83) and a horse named Falada in The Goose Girl.\n\nIn 1937 the publication and success of Wolf unter WÃƒÂ¶lfen (Wolf Among Wolves) marked Fallada's temporary return to his serious, realistic style. The Nazis read the book as a sharp criticism of the Weimar Republic, and thus naturally approved. Notably, Joseph Goebbels called it &quot;a super book&quot;. Goebbels's interest in Fallada's work would lead the writer to a world of worry: he would subsequently suggest the writer compose an anti-Semitic tract, and his praise indirectly resulted in Fallada's commission to write a novel that would be the basis for a state-sponsored film charting the life of a German family up to 1933.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe following torrent contains all the books in ePUB format:\n\n* Every Man Dies Alone\n\n* Little Man, What Now\n\n* The Drinker\n\n* Wolf Among Wolves\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRead the following articles, and SEED the torrent, and don't forget to give FEEDBACK!!!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Fallada&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Fallada&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a337a55bb0fa80268de931d6c7c110d3a5e105c","amp;dn":"Hans+Fallada+-+German+Author+%284+Books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a337a55bb0fa80268de931d6c7c110d3a5e105c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,51,122,85,187,15,168,2,104,222,147,29,108,124,17,13,58,94,16,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
