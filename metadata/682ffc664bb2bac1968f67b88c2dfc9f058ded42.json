With an air of experience and a touch of justified arrogance this album is sure out to exceed all your expectations of the â€˜pub rockâ€™ genre. Jimmy Barnes can still belt it out like he did in the early years of his and Cold Chiselsâ€™ career. The Perfect Crime sees the balance of hearty tunes that are full of heavy guitar, and slower songs that feature much more piano and a snappy beat.\r\n\r\nCold Chisel - The Perfect Crime On the jazzier side of the album is The Backroom a big, bold tune with a mighty story, the type youâ€™d expect from Cold Chisel married with an impressive piano solo. It promotes a feeling of grandeur with vast, building riffs and a swinging beat thatâ€™s almost reminiscent of 70s jazz. This is also the case with title track The Perfect Crime: itâ€™s full of catchy honky tonk piano riffs that give it a distinct rhythm and itâ€™s definitely one you can groove too while belting along with Barnes.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist : Cold Chisel\r\nAlbum : The Perfect Crime\r\nGenre : Rock\r\nYear : 2015\r\nTracks : 15\r\nPlaytime : 00:58:42\r\nSize : 140.76 MB\r\nCodec : MP 3 / Lame 3.99 / 320 kbps\r\n\r\n01.
