For example, the Sutta PiÃ¡Â¹Â­aka is broken up into five nikÃ„ï¿½yas:\n\nthe DÃ„Â«gha NikÃ„ï¿½ya, the collection of long (PÃ„ï¿½Ã¡Â¸Â·i: dÃ„Â«gha) discourses\nthe Majjhima NikÃ„ï¿½ya, the collection of middle-length (majjhima) discourses\nthe Samyutta NikÃ„ï¿½ya, the collection of thematically linked (samyutta) discourses\nthe Anguttara NikÃ„ï¿½ya, the &quot;gradual collection&quot; (discourses grouped by content enumerations)\nthe Khuddaka NikÃ„ï¿½ya, the &quot;minor collection&quot;\nIn the other early Buddhist schools the alternate term Ã„ï¿½gama was used instead of nikÃ„ï¿½ya to describe their Sutra PiÃ¡Â¹Â­akas. Thus the non-MahÃ„ï¿½yÃ„ï¿½na portion of the Sanskrit-language Sutra PiÃ¡Â¹Â­aka is referred to as &quot;the Ã„â‚¬gamas&quot; by MahÃ„ï¿½yÃ„ï¿½na Buddhists. The Ã„â‚¬gamas survive for the most part only in Classical Tibetan and Chinese translation. They correspond closely with the PÃ„ï¿½Ã¡Â¸Â·i nikÃ„ï¿½yas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9339a7fafa506761ca07dcb0ce8a65ed0720cb3","amp;dn":"Theravada+Buddhist+Scriptures+%2F+Nikayas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9339a7fafa506761ca07dcb0ce8a65ed0720cb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,51,154,127,175,165,6,118,28,160,125,203,12,232,166,94,208,114,12,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
