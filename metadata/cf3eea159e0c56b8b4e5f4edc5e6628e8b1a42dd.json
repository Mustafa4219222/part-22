It covers recent advances in the understanding of the biology of toxin producers and the factors involved in the appearance and dynamics of harmful algae blooms, the factors affecting toxin production, the synthesis of toxins both in natural producers and by chemical means in a lab, and the toxin groups posing continuing and novel hazards to living systems.\n\nPublisher: CRC Press (18 February 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1482210681\nISBN-13: 978-1482210682\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf3eea159e0c56b8b4e5f4edc5e6628e8b1a42dd","amp;dn":"%5BGian+Paolo+Rossini%5DToxins+and+Biologically+Active+Compounds+fro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf3eea159e0c56b8b4e5f4edc5e6628e8b1a42dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,62,234,21,158,12,86,184,180,229,244,237,197,230,98,142,139,26,66,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
