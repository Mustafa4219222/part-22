And no one conducts a more harrowing and suspenseful \nmanhunt than the modern Sherlock Holmes of the psyche, Dr. Alex Delaware.\n\nA tipsy young woman seeking aid on a desolate highway disappears into the \ninky black night. A retired schoolteacher is stabbed to death in broad \ndaylight. Two women are butchered after closing time in a small-town beauty \nparlor. These and other bizarre acts of cruelty and psychopathology are \nlinked only by the killer&amp;#039;s use of luxury vehicles and a baffling lack of motive. \nThe ultimate whodunits, these crimes demand the attention of LAPD \ndetective Milo Sturgis and his collaborator of the crime beat, psychologist \nAlex Delaware.\n\nWhat begins with a solitary bloodstain in a stolen sedan quickly spirals \noutward in odd and unexpected directions, leading Delaware and Sturgis from \nthe well-heeled center of L.A. society to its desperate edges; across the \npaths of commodities brokers and transvestite hookers; and as far away as \nNew York City, where the search thaws out a long-cold case and exposes a \ngrotesque homicidal crusade. The killer proves to be a fleeting shape-shifter, \ndefying identification, leaving behind dazed witnesses and deathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and \ncompelling Alex and Milo to confront the true face of murderous madness.\n\n----\n\nJonathan Kellerman is one of the world&amp;#039;s most popular authors. He has \nbrought his expertise as a clinical psychologist to more than two dozen \nbestselling crime novels, including the Alex Delaware series, The Butcher&amp;#039;s \nTheater, Billy Straight, The Conspiracy Club, and Twisted. With his wife, the \nnovelist Faye Kellerman, he co-authored the bestsellers Double Homicide and \nCapital Crimes. He is the author of numerous essays, short stories, scientific \narticles, two children&amp;#039;s books, and three volumes of psychology. He has won \nthe Goldwyn, Edgar, and Anthony awards. Jonathan and Faye Kellerman live \nin California and New Mexico. Their four children include the novelist Jesse \nKellerman.\n\n----\n\nJohn Rubinstein appeared on Broadway in Pippin, Children of a Lesser God, \nM. Butterfly, and Ragtime and starred in the television series Family. His \nfilms include 21 Grams and Red Dragon. He is also a composer and director.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d6680631758a6114bad0d7369052d3f6ebb1bce","amp;dn":"Jonathan+Kellerman+-+Compulsion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d6680631758a6114bad0d7369052d3f6ebb1bce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,102,128,99,23,88,166,17,75,173,13,115,105,5,45,63,110,187,27,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
