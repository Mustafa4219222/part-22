The fan reconstructions (uploaded by JohnnyFanboy) have linking narration between the dialogue whereas the loose cannon reconstructions (uploaded by Eldoctorio) have subtitles, all have a resolution of 640x480 with clean soundtracks.\n\nI was able to get the Lost in Time boxset, so the episodes from these partially missing serials are my own DVD rips: \nThe Underwater Menace (Part 3), The Moonbase (Part 2 and 4), The Faceless ones (Part 1 and 3), The Evil of the Daleks (Part 2), The abominable Snowmen (Part 2), The Enemy of the World (Part 3), The Web of Fear (Part 1), The Wheel of Space (Part 3 and 6), The Space Pirates (Part 2). \n\nAll the DVD rips have the following specs:\nVideo: Container - MKV, Codec - h264 @ 872 kbps, Resolution - 640x480 (4:3 aspect ratio)\nAudio: AAC @ 128 kbps\n\n0403 - The Power of the Daleks - Fan Reconstruction\n0404 - The Highlanders - Fan Reconstruction\n0405 - The Underwater Menace - Reconstruction by Loose Cannon.
