Using a series of unique vehicles, you'll transport citizens to safety while using an array of weapons to fend off extra-terrestrial attackers. There are a total of 30 missions to keep you occupied, and three different environments in which all of the action takes place: space, land, and beneath the moon's surface. Space travel might be easy in the 24th century, but battling aliens is still difficult.\n\n1.Extract anywhere.\n2.Press &quot;START THE GAME&quot; batch file.\n3.Play.\n\nCompatible with WIN-ALL\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93bd0fa966e9cabe27a2cc7f78947f8ad46eef9c","amp;dn":"Absolute+Zero+%281995%29+-+WIN-ALL+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93bd0fa966e9cabe27a2cc7f78947f8ad46eef9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,189,15,169,102,233,202,190,39,162,204,127,120,148,127,138,212,110,239,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
