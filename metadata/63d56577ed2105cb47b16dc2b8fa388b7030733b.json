The left says the right ignores global warming, denies evolution, and wants to ban stem-cell research. On the other hand, the right says the left leads ridiculous campaigns against vaccines, GMOs, plastics, and artificial sweeteners.\n\nJUNK SCIENTISTS: &quot;Experts&quot; like Al Gore, Bill Nye, and Neil deGrasse Tyson spout off all the time about climate change but they have almost no qualifications when it comes to climate science.\n\nFOOD MYTHS: Ladies...want to look like this?\n\nBeyoncÃƒÂ© says you too can have her body-- thanks to her new all-vegan meal plan. But is a diet with absolutely no meat, dairy, or eggs really healthy? Some fad diets aren't.\n\nGMOs: Lots of people are scared of them. The left says don't fool with Mother Nature, but people have been fooling with nature forever, and GMOs help feed millions of people.\n\nA LIBERTARIAN NIGHTMARE? Government quietly adds a chemical to our drinking water: fluoride. It does prevent cavities, but we can get fluoride in toothpaste now. Is it right for the government to add chemicals?\n\nMY TAKE: I used to think I could learn unbiased info by consulting &quot;impartial&quot; scientists. I'm less naÃƒÂ¯ve now. Scientists too have ulterior motives, like money. And scientists are just as interested in promoting themselves as everyone else. Let's be very skeptical when they say, give us your money and your freedom, so we can protect you\n\nFriday at 8PM ET on Fox Business Network\n\n_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2_,-'2\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Stossel.2015.06.19.Science.Wars.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO.mp4\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nFormat profile                           : Base Media\nCodec ID                                 : isom\nFile size                                : 349 MiB\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 185 Kbps\nWriting application                      : Lavf56.25.101\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : High@L3\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration                                 : 41mn 6s\nBit rate                                 : 1 047 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 624 pixels\nHeight                                   : 364 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.714\nFrame rate mode                          : Variable\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate                       : 9.990 fps\nMaximum frame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.154\nStream size                              : 308 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                          : x264 core 142 r2389 956c8d8\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x133 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=6 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=1047 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=10 / qpmax=51 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 41mn 7s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 37.6 MiB (11%)\nLanguage                                 : unk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d56577ed2105cb47b16dc2b8fa388b7030733b","amp;dn":"Stossel.2015.06.19.Science.Wars.WS.SDTV.x264-XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d56577ed2105cb47b16dc2b8fa388b7030733b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,213,101,119,237,33,5,203,71,177,109,194,184,250,56,139,112,48,115,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
