Though the soaring title ballad that opens the album celebrates the power of redemptive transformation, much of the material finds the duo pledging allegiance to roots that remain proudly hick (&quot;Hey Country,&quot; with its interplay of banjo and screaming rock guitars) and defiantly redneck (&quot;Redder,&quot; &quot;What Do You Think About That&quot;). Highlights include a deathbed reconciliation between a stubborn father and his rebellious son on &quot;20 Years Ago&quot; and a revenge song that channels a &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; groove on &quot;Your Tears Are Coming.&quot; Wherever Montgomery Gentry are taking their music, they haven&amp;#039;t forgotten where they came from\n \n \n\nInformation Disc:\n?
