The area in which it sank, located between two of the main breeding colonies of the African penguin, threatened approximately 75,000 penguins, more than 40 percent of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population. Within hours after the ship sank, heavily oiled penguins began to stream ashore onto nearby islands and beaches. As parents were unable to return to them, chicks left in the breeding colonies would slowly starve to death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8dd2e533c73699ae02433c6d1e1c420826ceab9","amp;dn":"The+Great+Penguin+Rescue%3A+40%2C000+Penguins%2C+a+Devastating+Oil","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8dd2e533c73699ae02433c6d1e1c420826ceab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,221,46,83,60,115,105,154,224,36,51,198,209,225,196,32,130,108,234,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
