The book covers all aspects of solid waste processing, volume reduction, and recycling, encompassing typical recyclable materials (paper, plastics, cans, and organics), construction and demolition debris, electronics, and more. It includes techniques, technologies, and programs to help maximize customer participation rates and revenues, as well as to minimize operating costs. The book is packed with lessons learned by the author during the implementation of the most successful programs worldwide, and includes numerous case studies showing how different systems work in different settings.\r\n\r\nThis book also takes on industry debates such as the merits of curbside-sort versus single-stream recycling and the use of advanced technology in materials recovery facilities. It provides key facts and figures, and brief summaries of legislation in the United States, Europe, and Asia. An extensive glossary demystifies the terminology and acronyms used in different sectors and geographies. The author also explains emerging concepts in recycling such as zero waste, sustainability, LEED certification, and pay-as-you-throw, and places waste management and recycling in wider economic, environmental (sustainability), political, and societal contexts.\r\n\r\nCovers single- and mixed-waste streams\r\nEvaluates the technologies and tradeoffs of recycling of materials vs. integrated solutions, including combustion and other transformational options\r\nCovers recycling as part of the bigger picture of solid waste management, processing and disposal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8174910255ef05e67e065ae15eb983106f2e1937","amp;dn":"Solid+Waste+Recycling+and+Processing+2nd+ed+-+Marc+J.+Rogoff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8174910255ef05e67e065ae15eb983106f2e1937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,116,145,2,85,239,5,230,126,6,90,225,94,185,131,16,111,46,25,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
