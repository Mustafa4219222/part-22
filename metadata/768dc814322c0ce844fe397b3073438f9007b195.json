The highly mobile two-wheeled war chariot, carrying a driver and an archer armed with a short composite bow, revolutionized military tactics after 1700 BC. This expensive weapon spread throughout the Middle East and is thought to have reached Egypt with the conquering Hyksos. It spread into Asia Minor, Greece, and was known in Northern Europe by 1500 BC. This book covers the evolution of the war chariot throughout the Bronze Age, detailing its design, development and combat history - in particular its fundamental involvement at the battle of Qadesh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:768dc814322c0ce844fe397b3073438f9007b195","amp;dn":"Bronze+Age+War+Chariots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"768dc814322c0ce844fe397b3073438f9007b195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,141,200,20,50,44,12,232,68,254,57,123,48,115,67,143,144,7,177,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
