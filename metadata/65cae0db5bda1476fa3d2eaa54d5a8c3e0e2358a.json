Formed in 1983, they are considered pioneers in the mainstream popularization of Christian rock/metal music. They have done what few other Christian bands have done; selling millions of albums to secular people and becoming one of MTV's most requested bands in the 80's. Stryper enjoyed great success during the late 80's before breaking up in 1992, when most 80's metal groups lost popularity. However, the band reunited in 2003.\n\nThe name &quot;Stryper&quot; derives from the King James Version of Isaiah 53:5:\n&quot;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.&quot;(1)\nThe scriptural reference is also part of Stryper's logo on most of their releases. In addition, the band's name has been said to stand for:\n\n&quot;Salvation Through Redemption, Yielding Peace,\nEncouragement, and Righteousness.&quot;\n\nDiscographia:\n\nSTRYPER - 1984 - The Yellow And Black Attack!\nSTRYPER - 1985 - Soldiers Under Command\nSTRYPER - 1986 - To Hell With The Devil\nSTRYPER - 1988 - In God We Trust\nSTRYPER - 1990 - Against The Law\nSTRYPER - 1991 - Cant Stop The Rock\nSTRYPER - 2000 - Live in Tokyo\nSTRYPER - 2001 -Cornerstone Festival\nSTRYPER - 2003 - Seven 7 - The Best Of Stryper\nSTRYPER - 2004 - 7 Weeks - Live in America, 2003\nSTRYPER - 2005 - Reborn\nSTRYPER - 2007 - Roxx Regime Demos\nSTRYPER - 2008 - Peace of Mind (single)\n\nGENERATED by http://heavensmetal.ucoz.ru/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65cae0db5bda1476fa3d2eaa54d5a8c3e0e2358a","amp;dn":"STRYPER+Discografia-by+heavensmetal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65cae0db5bda1476fa3d2eaa54d5a8c3e0e2358a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,202,224,219,91,218,20,118,250,61,46,170,84,213,168,195,224,226,53,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
