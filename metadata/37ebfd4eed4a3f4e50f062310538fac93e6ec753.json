In each place, they face challenges for which they need to combine their own talents with local techniques to outwit the environment they find themselves in. The series explores the incredible world of fishing, looking at its variety of fish and their behaviour in distinct environments, and revealing surprising animals and stunning landscapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Cuba \r\nThe seven anglers leave the freezing cold of Iceland for the tropical heat of Cuba - but violent storms make conditions tough. In the salt flats a couple of hours south of Havana, they chase the ghostly bonefish, and in the Bay of Pigs they must fish Cuban-style - on simple tyre tube boats. Finally, on the Atlantic coast they are after giant tarpon - the silver king. Matt Hayes is joined by local fishing guide Lazaro to help him judge which angler leaves the expedition whilst the rest journey on to the next location in their global expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/37/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b7/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/09/Earth-s-Wildest-Waters-The-Big-Fish-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CALVC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3001 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.30 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\nPart 5 has no Merged Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d9xfp","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37ebfd4eed4a3f4e50f062310538fac93e6ec753","amp;dn":"BBC+Earths+Wildest+Waters+The+Big+Fish+Series+1+2of6+Cuba+720p+x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37ebfd4eed4a3f4e50f062310538fac93e6ec753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,235,253,78,237,74,63,78,80,240,98,49,5,56,250,201,62,110,199,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
