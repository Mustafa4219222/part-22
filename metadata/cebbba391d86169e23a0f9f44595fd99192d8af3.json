World War 1 has come and gone  and  the  world  has\n     settled into an uneasy peace.  The alliance between the United  States\n     and the other powers is weak as the powers try to  maintain  peace  in\n     Europe.  Fearful of the growing strength of Japan, the  United  States\n     created a series of plans in case of a pacific war with Japan.   Their\n     name:  War Plan Orange.  Consisting of three different scenarios,  War\n     Plan Orange was a comprehensive and real life &quot;What if&quot;  scenario  for\n     the war in the pacific.  In the world  of  Matrix  Games  a  different\n     story is going to unfold, and Japan, seeking natural resources to grow\n     their power, will turn the full strength of  their  navy  against  the\n     industrial giant of the United States.\n\n     Enter War Plan Orange:  Dreadnoughts in the Pacific  1922-1930,  where\n     you will command the pacific fleet for either power in four  different\n     campaigns.  The two major campaigns will take you from 1922 - 1926 and\n     from 1926 - 1930.  With incredible attention to detail and  historical\n     accuracy, War Plan Orange is the perfect modification to  War  in  the\n     Pacific for anyone who loves the time period between World War  1  and\n     World War 2.  The lack of airpower and inefficient fuels, as  well  as\n     the natural resources required by both sides make War  Plan  Orange  a\n     completely different experience.\n\n     Additionally there are two PBEM scenarios included,  making  War  Plan\n     Orange powerful enough to stand on its own, as  well  as  one  of  the\n     largest mods and expansions to be released for any game.  War  in  the\n     Pacific fans will rejoice and newcomers  will  stand  in  awe  of  the\n     tactical battles that will be waged in one of the greatest  wars  that\n     never was (or at least, never was until more than a decade later).\n\n\n\n                 ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“   ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“\n                 ÃƒÅ“ Ãƒâ€º ÃƒÂ¾Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º ÃƒÅ“  ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º  Ãƒâ€º   Ãƒâ€º ÃƒÂ¾Ãƒâ€º ÃƒÅ¸ ÃƒÅ¸  ÃƒÅ¸  Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ“Ãƒâ€º Ãƒâ€º ÃƒÅ“\n              Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€º Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â°ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ãƒâ€º Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€º Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ“Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ“ Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€º Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ“Ãƒâ€º Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€º Ã‚Â°Ãƒâ€ºÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ã‚Â°ÃƒÅ“ÃƒÅ“Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°\n\n\n     1 .
