Doctors are handing out antibiotics to everyone, and have been doing so for almost 100 years.  We\r\nknow infections are a major problem, but do we fully realize the extent of how they make us feel miserable and ruin people's lives? \r\nYeast, fungus, mold, mycotoxins and candida are just a few of the various terms related to the overgrowth of infectious organisms. If you\r\nhave struggled with any level of bronchitis, pneumonia, UTI's, bladder infections, kidney infections, yeast infections, re-occurring\r\nsickness, MRSA, herpes, lyme's disease or any other infection-related concern, this cleanse is for you. The infection in the body is a\r\nliving organism that eats, breathes, and yes, poops.  This is what is creating the acidic condition of the body and the miserable\r\nsymptoms most people have.  The waste created is acetaldehyde, a toxic alcohol byproduct to the surrounding tissues and organs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef22ac9a966a376a182eac3e1a448264d3f14147","amp;dn":"21-Day+Microbe+%26amp%3B+Parasite+Cleanse+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef22ac9a966a376a182eac3e1a448264d3f14147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,34,172,154,150,106,55,106,24,46,172,62,26,68,130,100,211,241,65,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
