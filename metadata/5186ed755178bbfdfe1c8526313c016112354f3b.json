BL tells the story of Eddie Riggs member of a band. Eddie is the first person everyone calls when they need guitars tuned. Risk lover and a photographic memory for all album covers of Heavy Metal and letters containing those albums. One night Eddie has an accident on stage and falls unconscious.\nWith blood streaming down on the belt buckle he wears, a gift from his father, a fighter character and yet oddly familiar, a world where every Heavy Metal cover and lyrics come to life, a world where evil emperor and Doviculus and demonic army, &quot;The Tainted Coil&quot;, have enslaved the human past. Led by Lars Halford alongside his sister Lita and the mysterious Ophelia, the human resistance is by no means helpless.\nAnyway, no one who can organize and lead them into battle, who need it to Eddie. Under his command, returned the old world to the world of Metal.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMinimum:\n-------\nOS: Windows XP SP3\nProcessor: 1.8 GHz dual-core CPU\nMemory: 1 GB RAM\nGraphics Card: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 graphics\nDirectX Ã‚Â®: 9.0c\nHard Drive: 8 GB HD space\nSound: Sound card compatible with DirectX\nOther Requirements: Broadband Internet\n\nRecommended:\n-------------\nOperating System: Windows 7\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2 GHz or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHz\nMemory: 1 GB RAM\nGraphics Card: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 Graphics\nDirectX Ã‚Â®: 9.0c\nHard Drive: 8 GB HD space\nSound: Sound card compatible with DirectX\nOther Requirements: Broadband Internet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5186ed755178bbfdfe1c8526313c016112354f3b","amp;dn":"Brutal+Legend+%282013%29+%5BPCDVD%5D%5BMULTI%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5186ed755178bbfdfe1c8526313c016112354f3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,134,237,117,81,120,187,253,254,28,133,38,49,60,1,97,18,53,79,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
