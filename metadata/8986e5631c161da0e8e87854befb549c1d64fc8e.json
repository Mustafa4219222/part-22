THE war. There is no stopping; no getting out. You're in this - just like the rest of us - to the end.&quot;\nDriven out of hell and with nothing to lose, the Fallen wage open warfare against the angels on the streets. And they're winning.\n\nAs the balance tips towards the darkness, Alice - barely recovered from her own ordeal in hell and struggling to start over - once again finds herself in the eye of the storm. But with the chaos spreading and the Archangel Michael determined to destroy Lucifer whatever the cost, is the price simply too high? \n\nAnd what sacrifices will Alice and the angels have to make in order to pay it?\nThe Fallen will rise. Trust will be betrayed. And all hell breaks loose...\n\nGenre: Urban Fantasy, Paranormal / Demons, Fantasy, Young Adult","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8986e5631c161da0e8e87854befb549c1d64fc8e","amp;dn":"Rebellion+by+Lou+Morgan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8986e5631c161da0e8e87854befb549c1d64fc8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,134,229,99,28,22,29,160,232,232,120,84,190,251,84,156,29,100,252,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
