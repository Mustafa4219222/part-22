This set took nearly a decade to follow the first, but it's been well worth the wait Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the crew at Soul Jazz have clearly used all that time to dig way past the obvious on the New Orleans scene, and come up with a really incredible batch of all-funky cuts all the way through! Even if you've got a dozen other New Orleans funk collections in your collection, you'll find plenty here to win you over Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the package goes out of its way to pull cuts from rare singles and under-reissued material Ã¢â‚¬â€œ then wraps the whole thing up with the usual extra-thorough Soul Jazz approach to liner notes and details. And while some of the names are familiar here, they're nicely interspersed with lesser-known folks who keep things fresh Ã¢â‚¬â€œ making for a winning lineup that really sets a new standard for this sort of set. \n~Dusty Groove\n\n01.
