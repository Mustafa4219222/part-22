Set in ancient Rome, leading citizens Cassius and Marcus Brutus are alarmed that the power and authority Caesar is assuming may endanger the democracy of the Republic, so they conspire to assassinate the popular general. The ensuing battles and suicides extend the tragedy, establishing neither a clear-cut hero nor villain.\r\n\r\nCast and Creatives\r\n\r\nDirected for the stage by Dominic Dromgoole\r\nDirected for the Screen by  Ross MacGibbon\r\n\r\n Designer,        Jonathan Fensom \r\n composer,        Claire van Kampen\r\n choreographer,   Sian Williams\r\n fight director,  Kevin McCurdy \r\n\r\n Executive producers, Dominic Dromgoole, Robert Marshall ;\r\n producers, Lotte Buchan, Jessica Lusk.\r\n\r\n\r\nCast \t\r\n\r\nGeorge Irving,          Julius Caesar\r\nChristopher  Logan      Casca  \r\nTom McKay,              Brutus\r\nCatherine Bailey,       Portia \r\nJoe Jameson,            Octavius\r\nKeith Ramsay,           Lucius\r\nLuke Thompson,          Marc Antony\r\nSam Cox,                Marulis\r\nPatrick Driver,         Flavius\r\nAnthony Howell.

Antony and Cleopatra was also recently done by the Globe and will be part of this series of my fileshares.  The history dramas are presented in a more straightforward manner.  And of course Julius Caesar has some of the great scenes such as the funeral oration and what have become popular cliches of speech.  Julius Caesar is the source of the phrase 'it was all Greek to me.'  A big line for the audience to appreciate.\r\n\r\n  For comparison,  in my collection is the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of this play directed by Gregory Doran.  That is a non-traditional interpretation but a great experience of the play.  I'll not give away more about it.  It's on the 'Bay in my collection.\r\n\r\n  A note of appreciation to those who are seeding these Globe productions so that others might enjoy them and get the dvds for their libraries at schools and universities.  Please join me in keeping them going as long as possible, preferably for years to come.\r\n\r\n The dvds vary in how many subtitle translations they have and I try to include all in recent efforts.  This one has English subtitles from the original available to your player.\r\n\r\nNotes written November 5th,  2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfbc919d9a534b7bb5b66ceabc485721a4485bab","amp;dn":"Shakespeare%27s+Globe+On+Screen+Julius+Caesar+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfbc919d9a534b7bb5b66ceabc485721a4485bab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,188,145,157,154,83,75,123,181,182,108,234,188,72,87,33,164,72,91,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
