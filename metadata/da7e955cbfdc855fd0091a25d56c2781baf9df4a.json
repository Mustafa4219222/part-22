After years of painstaking research, David Maislish uncovers the murder or attempted murder of every single King and Queen. Here is English history without the things that sent us to sleep in school; instead brought to life with a series of royal murders and near murders. Read how a quarter, perhaps as many as half, of our Kings and Queens were killed - even one in the twentieth century. It is all in Assassination - the Royal Family's 1000-year curse.\n\n---\n\nMOBI\n\nThe preface is poorly formatted. Chapters look good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da7e955cbfdc855fd0091a25d56c2781baf9df4a","amp;dn":"Assassination+by+Maislish+-+spanikopita","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da7e955cbfdc855fd0091a25d56c2781baf9df4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,126,149,92,191,220,133,95,208,9,26,37,213,108,39,129,186,249,223,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
