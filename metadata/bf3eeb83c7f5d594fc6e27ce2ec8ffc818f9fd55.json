Mussolini appoints General Rodolfo Graziani (Oliver Reed) governor of Lybia, confident that he can crush the rebellion and restore the glories of Imperial Rome. Inspirational in the Bedouin resistance toward the oppressors is the leadership of one man Omar Mukhtar (Anthony Quinn). A teacher by profession, guerrilla by obligation, Mukhtar has committed himself to a war that cannot be won in his lifetime. Making a film of such epic proportions as Lion of teh Desert demanded the approach of planning a vast military campaign. Whole villages had to be built to house the cast and crew of 400 in remote filming locations, along with a medical center to treat ailments from scorpion stings, to heat stroke, to broken bones suffered in battle scenes..\n\nOther features: Interactive Menus, Scene Access, Cast, Film credits, Filmographies\n\nDvd9 Untouched\n\nSOLODVD ORG","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf3eeb83c7f5d594fc6e27ce2ec8ffc818f9fd55","amp;dn":"LION+OF+THE+DESERT%2C+1981++PAL++FULLDVD+Spanish%2CEnglish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf3eeb83c7f5d594fc6e27ce2ec8ffc818f9fd55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,62,235,131,199,245,213,148,252,110,39,206,46,200,255,200,24,249,253,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
