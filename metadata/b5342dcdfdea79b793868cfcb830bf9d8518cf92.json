The initial lineup also included Off &amp; Gone's Phil Western and Mark Spybey of Dead Voices on Air, but has since been particularly fluid, with Key and Western being the only constant members following Goettel's death. Download's music has been described as post-industrial, drawing from the band's genesis as part of Skinny Puppy but also sharing common stylistic ground with such artists as Aphex Twin and Autechre. The primary instrumentation common throughout their albums is a blend of synthesizers and sampled instruments; the music is particularly centered on elements of percussion and rhythm.\n\nComplete Discography - 12 Releases - MP3 Format\n\n1995 - Furnace (192 kbps)\n1996 - Microscopic [EP] (320 kbps)\n1996 - Sidewinder [EP] (320 kbps)\n1996 - Eyes of Stanley Pain (192 kbps)\n1997 - Charlie's Family [Soundtrack] (320 kbps)\n1997 - III (320 kbps)\n2000 - Effector (320 kbps)\n2002 - III Steps Forward (320 kbps)\n2002 - Inception: The Subconscious Jams 1994 - 1995 (320 kbps)\n2007 - FiXeR (320 kbps)\n2011 - Helicopter + Wookie Wall (320 kbps)\n2013 - Lingam (320 kbps)\n\nAlbum Art Included - ID3 Tagged\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5342dcdfdea79b793868cfcb830bf9d8518cf92","amp;dn":"Download+Discography+-+cEvin+Key+of+Skinny+Puppy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5342dcdfdea79b793868cfcb830bf9d8518cf92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,52,45,205,253,234,121,183,147,134,140,252,184,48,191,157,133,24,207,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
