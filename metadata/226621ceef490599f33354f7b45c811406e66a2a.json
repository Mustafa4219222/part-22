Producer Steve Lillywhite imposed a more disciplined approach in the studio than Elvis Costello had, but he had the good sense not to squeeze the life out of the band in the process; as a result, the Pogues sound tighter and more precise than ever, while still summoning up the glorious howling fury that made Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash so powerful. And Shane MacGowan continued to grow as a songwriter, as his lyrics and melodies captured with brilliant detail his obsession with the finer points of Anglo-Irish culture. &quot;Fairytale of New York,&quot; a glorious sweet-and-sour duet with Kirsty MacColl, and &quot;The Broad Majestic Shannon&quot; were subtle in a way many of his previous work was not, &quot;Birmingham Six&quot; found him addressing political issues for the first time (and with all the expected venom), and &quot;Fiesta&quot; and &quot;Turkish Song of the Damned&quot; found him adding (respectively) faux-Spanish and Middle Eastern flavors into the Pogues' heady mix. And if you want to hear the Pogues blaze through some fast ones, &quot;Bottle of Smoke&quot; and the title song find them doing just what they've always done best. Brilliantly mixing passion, street smarts, and musical ambition, If I Should Fall from Grace with God is the best album the Pogues would ever make.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:226621ceef490599f33354f7b45c811406e66a2a","amp;dn":"The+Pogues+-+If+I+Should+Fall+From+Grace+With+God+%5Bflac%5D+Remaste","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"226621ceef490599f33354f7b45c811406e66a2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,102,33,206,239,73,5,153,243,51,84,247,180,92,129,20,6,230,106,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
