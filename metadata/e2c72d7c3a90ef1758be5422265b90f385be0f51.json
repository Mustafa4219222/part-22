Van Halen influences are prominent, which is ironic given singer Gary Cherone's post-Extreme career. \n\nThis album, like all of Extreme's work, is notable for Nuno Bettancourt's guitar playing, but the songs aren't bad either, mostly examining childhood from a playful but oddly mature perspective. &quot;Kid Ego,&quot; their first single, is here, as well as &quot;Mutha (Don't Want to Go to School Today),&quot; &quot;Little Girls,&quot; &quot;Big Boys Don't Cry,&quot; and the rock-out finale &quot;Play with Me.&quot; \n\nThere are a few ballads as well: &quot;Watching, Waiting&quot; is particularly poignant and surprisingly spiritual in content. \nThis album showed Extreme's considerable potential.\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; flac\n\nIncluded: NFO, PLS, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers; Front \nTags: VorbisComment\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n01.
