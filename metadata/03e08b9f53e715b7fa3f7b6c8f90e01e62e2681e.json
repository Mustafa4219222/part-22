In the Fourth and Fifth Centuries BC, the Greeks built an empire that stretched across the Mediterranean from Asia to Spain. They laid the foundations of modern science, politics, warfare and philosophy, and produced some of the most breathtaking art and architecture the world has ever seen. This series, narrated by Liam Neeson, recounts the rise, glory, demise and legacy of the empire that marked the dawn of Western civilization. The story of this astonishing civilization is told through the lives of heroes of ancient Greece. The latest advances in computer and television technology rebuild the Acropolis, recreate the Battle of Marathon and restore the grandeur of the Academy, where Socrates, Plato and Aristotle forged the foundation of Western though.\nThe series combines dramatic storytelling, stunning imagery, new research and distinguished scholarship to render classical Greece gloriously alive.\n\nApprox. running time: 165 min.\n\nSeries Director And Writer : Cassian Harrison\nAtlantic Productions in association with PBS and Devillier Donegan Enterprises (1999)\n\nEpisode 2 : Golden Age\nThe second part recounts the Greeks' heroic victory against the mighty Persian empire through the life of Themistocles, one of Athens' greatest generals.The episode opens in 490 B.C. when tiny Athens prepares to safeguard its growing economy and infant democracy against an invasion by Persian armies of Darius the Great. When the Persians arrive for battle, the Greek courier Phidippides runs 140 miles to Sparta in two days to solicit help from its army, according the historian Herodotus. But Sparta, Athens' rival, refuses to participate. The outnumbered Athenians, fighting to uphold their life of freedom, defeat the Persians and send them in humiliation back to Asia. But one Athenian, Themistocles, realizes Athens has not seen the last of the proud Persians. He persuades city leaders to build a fleet of war ships. These ships, called triremes, are &quot;floating missiles&quot; with projecting bows designed specifically to ram enemy vessels. While the Athenians execute their plans, the Persian ruler Darius dies and his son Xerxes succeeds to the throne. Under pressure to take revenge against the Greeks, he assembles an army of two million men. When the terrified Greeks ask the Delphic Oracle for advice, she simply tells them to flee. But Themistocles refuses to panic. Instead, he again petitions the Delphic Oracle, and this time she predicts that a &quot;wooden wall&quot; will protect the Greeks. First, he orders Athens abandoned, installs his fleet at the Aegean island of Salamis, and sends a &quot;traitor&quot; to the Persians to tell them that the Athenians are fleeing and are easy prey for the Persian fleet. When Persian ships move into the strait between Salamis and the Greek mainland, the triremes ram and sink 200 Persian vessels, and Athens wins the war. Greece, now master of the Mediterranean, undergoes one of the most startling intellectual and physical transformations in history. Pericles, the elected leader of Athens, oversees the building of the Parthenon and an extraordinary flourishing of the arts and sciences, laying the foundation for what is now called &quot;Western culture.&quot;\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2039 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x400\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.760:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 50:53.581\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 854,843,392 Bytes\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03e08b9f53e715b7fa3f7b6c8f90e01e62e2681e","amp;dn":"PBS.Empires.The.Greeks.Crucible.of.Civilization.2of3.Golden.Age.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03e08b9f53e715b7fa3f7b6c8f90e01e62e2681e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,224,139,159,83,231,21,183,250,63,123,108,143,144,224,30,98,226,104,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
