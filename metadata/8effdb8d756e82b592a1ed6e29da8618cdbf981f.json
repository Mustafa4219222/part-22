The album features several of the band's most well-known songs, including &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot;, &quot;Simple Man&quot;, &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot;, the latter of which launched the band to national stardom.\nBassist Leon Wilkeson left the band during the album's early recording sessions only playing on two tracks. Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King was asked to fill in for Wilkeson on bass during the remaining sessions, as Wilkeson already wrote many of the bass parts. This left Skynyrd with only six official members at the time of the album's release. Not long after, King remained with the band, and was made a member, so that they could replicate the triple-guitar lead during live performances. Wilkeson returned to the band when it was time to take the photo for the album cover and embark on the tour for the album. It was certified gold on December 18, 1974, platinum and 2x platinum on July 21 1987 by the RIAA.\nThe album was re-released in 2001 as an expanded version with bonus tracks, including demos of many of the songs on the album.\n\n\nCountry: USA\nGenre: Rock, Southern rock, hard rock, boogie rock, blues rock, country rock, roots rock\nQuality: FLAC, tracks, +.cue\n\nTracklist:\n1.
