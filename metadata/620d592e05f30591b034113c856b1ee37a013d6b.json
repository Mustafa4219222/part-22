Actually, half of this album features a medium-sized group from Basie's big band, but his orchestra usually had the feel of a small group anyway. Soloists at this late stage include Eric Dixon and Kenny Hing on tenors, trombonist Booty Wood, altoist Danny Turner and four different trumpeters. The rhythm section is of course instantly recognizable and the music is very much in the Basie tradition. \n\n\nBob Summers, Sonny Cohn, Dale Carley &amp; Chris Albert - Trumpets\nBill Hughes, Dennis Wilson, Grover Mitchell &amp; Mitchell 'Booty' Wood - Trombones\nKenny Hing, Eric Dixon, Johnny Williams, Bobby Plater &amp; Danny Turner - Reeds\nCount Basie - Piano\nFreddie Green - Guitar\nJames Leary - Bass\nGregg Field - Drums\n\n\n01.
