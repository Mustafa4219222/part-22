This has been fixed.\nIf multiple monitors were used in the past, the Mixer &amp; Edit windows have their position stored in that location which would make them unavailable when only one monitor is connected. This has been fixed.\n\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nCPU Architecture:\nIntel or AMD,   64bit or 32 bit\n2+ cores/processors required\n\nOS Version:\nWindows XP Pro or newer\n\nAudio:\nAny system soundcard should work.
