Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.\nThe book was initially intended to be a serious travel guide,[1] with accounts of local history along the route, but the humorous elements took over to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages seem a distraction to the comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the jokes seem fresh and witty even today.[2]\nThe three men are based on Jerome himself (the narrator J.) and two real-life friends, George Wingrave (who went on to become a senior manager in Barclays Bank) and Carl Hentschel (the founder of a London printing business, called Harris in the book), with whom he often took boating trips. The dog, Montmorency, is entirely fictional[1] but, &quot;as Jerome admits, developed out of that area of inner consciousness which, in all Englishmen, contains an element of the dog.&quot;[2] The trip is a typical boating holiday of the time in a Thames camping skiff.[Note 2] This was just after commercial boat traffic on the Upper Thames had died out, replaced by the 1880s craze for boating as a leisure activity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91de3f051434ae253c42755657580ff8ad836556","amp;dn":"Jerome_K_Jerome_-_Three_Men_in_a_Boat.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91de3f051434ae253c42755657580ff8ad836556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,222,63,5,20,52,174,37,60,66,117,86,87,88,15,248,173,131,101,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
