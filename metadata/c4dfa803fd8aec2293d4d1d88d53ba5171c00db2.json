Whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a dude, a dad, or someone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s married to either, fasten your seat belt and prepare to crack up. The least hip citizen of Brooklyn, Dan Zevin has a working wife, two small children, a mother who visits each week to Ã¢â‚¬Å“help,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and an obese Labrador mutt who prefers to be driven rather than walked. How he got to this point is a bit of a blur. There was a wedding, and then there was a puppy. A home was purchased in New England. A wife was promoted and transferred to New York. A town house. A new baby boy. A new baby girl. A stay-at-home dad was born. A prescription for Xanax was filled. Gray hairs appeared; gray hairs fell out. Six years passed in six seconds. And then came the minivan.\n\nDan Zevin, master of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seinfeld-ian nothingnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Time), is trying his best to make the transition from couplehood to familyhood. Acclimating to the adult-oriented lifestyle has never been his strong suit, and this slice-of-midlife story chronicles the whole hilarious journeyÃ¢â‚¬â€from instituting date night to joining Costco; from touring Disneyland to recovering from knee surgery; from losing ambition to gaining perspective. Where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all heading is anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guess, but, for Dan, suburbiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s callingÃ¢â‚¬â€and his minivan has GPS.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4dfa803fd8aec2293d4d1d88d53ba5171c00db2","amp;dn":"Dan+Gets+a+Minivan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4dfa803fd8aec2293d4d1d88d53ba5171c00db2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,223,168,3,253,138,236,34,147,212,209,216,141,83,186,81,113,192,13,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
