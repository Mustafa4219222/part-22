Don't Turn Around 4:47\n2. Funkttown (It's Not Forever) 5:15\n3. Jim 2:46\n4. Elsewhere 5:50\n5. Goin' Home 5:53\n\nWhy do you walk instead of drive? Why do you talk to the people you do? Why do you sing in the streets? Why do you travel the world? Why do you play music? For the Experiences. We live for the experiences. To see new things and meet new people. Each song is a different experience entirely. Each person, each day and every lesson learned. Every experience has it's own flavor, it's own genre, it's length, depth, meaning, GROOVE\n\n\nOn Your Way Out: On You Way Out is a themed EP. It was written at the end of a period of all out lives that we will never forget. It's advice, it's warning, it's discovery, it's renewal. We did all the recording, producing, writing, EVERYTHING ourselves. We are really excited with the results after undergoing such a project and hope you enjoy! \n\nNOTE: If you don't have the FLAC codec grab it here for WMP - http://xiph.org/dshow/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc8f4659df817fe4f1abcdb060a4a912e4b94201","amp;dn":"The+Experiences+-+On+Your+Way+Out+EP+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc8f4659df817fe4f1abcdb060a4a912e4b94201","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,143,70,89,223,129,127,228,241,171,205,176,96,164,169,18,228,185,66,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
