Conversing. Connecting. When did it become so difficult? And how do we begin to change it for the better?\nThis book was designed to help parents answer these important questions, and it is based on two fundamental ideas: The first is that there are no bad children, and no deliberately bad parents -- but that sometimes, despite the best of intentions on both sides, there can be bad relationships between parents and children. The second is that, as parents, we must do everything we can to save those relationships, to reach out and really communicate with our children, because it is only through talking to them that we can create an environment for inspiration and change.\n\nIn this compelling book, Shmuley Boteach, passionate social commentator and outspoken relationship guru, walks you through the critical conversations, including: cherishing childhood; developing intellectual curiosity; knowing who you are and what you want to become; learning to forgive; realizing the importance of family and tradition; being fearless and courageous. As a father of eight, Rabbi Shmuley speaks from a wealth of experience. He has written a book for parents of children of all ages, from toddlers, who are just beginning to become aware of the world around them, to adolescents, who must learn to navigate all sorts of tricky social and academic pressures.\n\n10 Conversations will help you stay connected to your children so that they develop the kind of strong moral character that leads to rich, meaningful lives...........................\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f01cc0000fff10243acfc02d5e5d4766a949fe46","amp;dn":"10+Conversations+You+Need+to+Have+with+Your+Children-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f01cc0000fff10243acfc02d5e5d4766a949fe46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,28,192,0,15,255,16,36,58,207,192,45,94,93,71,102,169,73,254,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
