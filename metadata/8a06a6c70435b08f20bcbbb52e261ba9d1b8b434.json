Lorge\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nChinese rulers and statesmen were naturally concerned about the issue of war, when to wage it, when it was justified, and when to avoid it. Although much has been asserted about how these issues were understood in Chinese culture, this work is the first study actually to focus on the debates themselves. These debates at court proceeded from specific understandings of what constituted evidence, and involved the practical concerns of policy as well as more general cultural values. The result is a decidedly messy portrait of Chinese decision making over two millenia that is neither distinctly Chinese nor entirely generic.\nContributors are Parks Coble, Garret Olberding, David Pong, Kenneth Swope, Paul Van Els, David Wright, and Shu-Hui Wu.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a06a6c70435b08f20bcbbb52e261ba9d1b8b434","amp;dn":"Debating+War+in+Chinese+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a06a6c70435b08f20bcbbb52e261ba9d1b8b434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,6,166,199,4,53,176,143,32,188,187,181,46,38,27,169,209,184,180,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
