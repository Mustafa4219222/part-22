We must mention that, since the catalogue has not yet been updated to take into account the result of recent research, several of these works are still included in the supplement ('Anhang'), to which material of doubtful attribution was relegated. The countless features that could be mentioned for each of these compositions - diversity of writing, structure, themes, concepts, context - lead us to conclude that the Vivaldian concerto was underpinned by strong formal and instrumental traditions, to which the composer brought the fruits of his experimentation ingenuity and boundless imagination, adding dramatic qualities, emotion and joy. For Vivaldi the concerto was a perfect vehicle for freedom, enabling him at the same time to magnify the human passion.\nOlivier FourÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s\n\n--------------- Tracks ------------------------------------\nConserto per Violino in re minore RV Anh 01 Allegro, Adagio\n02 Allegro, Adagio\n03 Andante\n04 Largo\n05 Allegro\n\nConserto per violino in si bemole maggiore RV 381\n06 Allegro\n07 Adagio\n08 Allegro\n\nConserto per violino in re maggiore RV 220\n09 Allegro\n10 Largo\n11 Allegro\n\nConserto per violino in fa maggiore RV 291\n12 Allegro, Adagio\n13 Larghetto\n14 allegro\n\nConserto per Violino in do maggiore RV 175\n15 Andante\n16 Adagio, Allegro\n17 Adagio\n18 Allegro, Adagio\n19 Allegro\n\nConserto per Violino in la minore RV 355\n20 Andante, adagio\n21 Allegro, Adagio\n22 Alla breve\n===============================================\n\nCd2\nConserto per violino in la maggiore RV 338\n01 Allegro\n02 Adagio\n03 Allegro\n\nConserto per Violino in mi minore RV 274\n04 Allegro, Adagio, Allegro\n05 Adagio e staccato\n06 Allegro\n\nConserto per Violino in in do maggiore RV 176\n07 allegro\n08 Largo\n09 Allegro\n\nConserto per violino in mi minore RV 275\n10 Vivace\n11 Adagio\n12 Allegro\n\nConserto per violino in si bemole magriore RV 377\n13 Allegro\n14 Adagio\n15 Allegro\n\nConserto per violino in fa maggiore RV Anh 130\n16 Allegro\n17 Adagio\n18 Allegro\n\nMore information on the cd coverrs\n\nmuzik62\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b3fb414b9cd4f5faf71145eed7f26ea7f6ccce","amp;dn":"Vivaldi+-+Violin+per+Conserti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b3fb414b9cd4f5faf71145eed7f26ea7f6ccce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,179,251,65,75,156,212,245,250,247,17,69,238,215,242,110,167,246,204,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
