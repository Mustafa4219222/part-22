The princely poppers provide the perfect atmosphere for Foley's powerful theatrics on her inaugural flight. The second single, &quot;What's a Matter Baby,&quot; soars just as high in the stratosphere: a little bit '50s, but a whole lot cosmic. It's a crime music which hides in the recesses of the past, because this gem is priceless, if only for the first two tracks. Ronson's axe is exemplary throughout: shooting over Mars and then swooping back through nocturnal cityscapes. He twists &quot;Heartful of Soul&quot; into &quot;Young Lust&quot; and makes a break for it in &quot;Hide Away.&quot; Obviously haunted by midnight Spectors, kindred spirit Hunter supplies the perfect keyboard counterpart: mission control for Ronson's rockets. The swirling storm whipping through Gram Parker's &quot;Thunder and Rain&quot; builds to an almost unbearable compression of intensity. In the eye of this celestial storm, Foley scats, scolds, swoons, croons, pouts, pleads, and purrs in a rich tone that few femme fatales possess, scaling a towering wall of sonic seduction. The sublime proceedings finally slow down to a crawl for fallout &quot;Don't Let Go,&quot; but it's just the mourning after an unforgettable Night Out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36dd8d283b523a1829df0f971a2a5e2b374d31ca","amp;dn":"Ellen+Foley+-+Night+Out+%5B1979%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36dd8d283b523a1829df0f971a2a5e2b374d31ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,221,141,40,59,82,58,24,41,223,15,151,26,42,94,43,55,77,49,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
