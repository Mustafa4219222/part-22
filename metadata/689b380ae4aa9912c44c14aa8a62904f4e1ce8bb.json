An excellent sophomore installment from one of contemporary country music's brightest lights.\n\nThis follow-up to Yoakam's sensational debut Guitars,Cadillacs is an equally compelling dose of his straight-ahead, irresistible Bakersfield country. In the mould of his heroes Buck Owens and Merle Haggard, Yoakam works a no-frills, traditional honky tonk sound, yet brings to the form a touch of twang guitar rockabilly and his own spin on convention. Yoakam's stripped down aesthetic, wiry guitar leads, and laid-back but stylized vocals (not to mention back-ups that occasionally sound like they're sung with tongue in cheek) hint that the singer likes to tweak the sacred cow of country, even as he rides it.\n\nTracklist\n1 Little Ways 3:25 \n2 Smoke Along the Track 3:14 \n3 Johnson's Love 4:31 \n4 Please, Please Baby 3:36\n5 Readin', Rightin', RT. 3:33 \n6 Always Late (With Your Kisses) 2:13 \n7 1,000 Miles 12 \n8 Throughout All Time 3:54 \n9 Little Sister3:05 \n10 This Drinkin' Will Kill Me 2:33\n\nPersonnel includes:[/b][/color] Dwight Yoakam (vocals, acoustic guitar); Pete Anderson (electric guitar, bass); Greg Leisz (lap steel guitar); Tom Brumley (pedal steel guitar); Brantley Kearns (fiddle, background vocals); Skip Edwards (piano); J.D.
