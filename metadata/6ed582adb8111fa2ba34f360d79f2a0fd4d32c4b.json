It asks the brutal\nquestion of what happens to the children when the branches are cut and the tree\nis killed, as well as questions of leadership and societal upbringing. The six\nmusicians of Angles make this a personal matter through their music, as each\ntrack is unified by the sense that the men are all deeply affected by current\nworldly affairs. From the opening piece, an overwhelming frustration and even\ndisgust with the world's current state is apparent. The music depicts a\n21st-century depression: a poverty of life and mercy augmented by a wealth of\nwar, violence and terror.\n\n[...]\n\n\nBy Stef - Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© stef\n\nMagic from Sweden, published in Portugal. This Swedish band consists of Johan\nBerthling on double bass, Kjell Nordeson on drums, Magnus Broo on trumpet,\nMartin Kuchen on alto sax, Mats Aleklint on trombone and Mattias Stahl on\nvibraphone. The band brings a strong anti-war album here, and an ode to women in\nwar-time, the &quot;trees&quot; that hold the families together. The music has this\nunbelievable combination of energy, melodic beauty and emotional\nsensitivity. Some of the tracks are wonderful, and possibly among the best I've\nheard this year. The opening track starts with arco bass, followed by dramatic\nand sad alto sax, with the vibes offering the right supportive touches, then the\nrhythm instruments move into a unison theme, opening the floor for the rest of\nthe band to join in the sad melody. The bass also has a long intro for the\nsecond track, now on pizzi, for another wailing and tearful theme by the rest of\nthe band. The title track is brilliant, with a strong and sweeping melody, very\nmoving and heartfelt, offering lots of possibilities for expansion, and played\nin a wonderful African call-and-response mode, including percussive\npolyrhythmics and a staggering trumpet solo by Broo. And the next piece is great\ntoo, starting with a gut-wrenching sax solo by KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼chen over a slow and bluesy\nrhythm, which offers the right background for the ensuing vibe and trombone\nsolos. Those who know KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼chen and Nordeson from their work with Exploding\nCustomer will find similarities in the music, albeit less joyful here of course,\nand richer because of the additional instruments. The music is rhythmic,\nmelodic, with a clear structural approach of theme, improvisations and back to\ntheme, although a little more sophisticated than I describe it. But\ncompositional power is one thing, the major achievement is in the performance\nitself, which is warm, sad and wonderful. A great album.\n\n\nEn castellano:\n-------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2008/11/05/angles-every-woman-is-a-tree/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://elintruso.com/2008/11/05/angles-every-woman-is-a-tree/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2008-10-01#every_woman-tree&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tomajazz.com/discos/breves.php?d=2008-10-01#every_woman-tree&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ed582adb8111fa2ba34f360d79f2a0fd4d32c4b","amp;dn":"Angles+-+Every+Woman+is+a+Tree+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ed582adb8111fa2ba34f360d79f2a0fd4d32c4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,213,130,173,184,17,31,162,186,52,243,96,215,159,42,15,212,211,44,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
