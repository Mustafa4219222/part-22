However, he regrets his decision and informs Hayes he intends to return the gold. Later, during a raid on a warehouse, Nick and Hayes get into a shootout with criminals, and Hayes kills Nick to prevent him from returning the gold, framing one of the criminals for the murder. While ascending through a tunnel in the sky to the afterlife, Nick is pulled into the office of Mildred Proctor, director of the Boston division of the Rest In Peace Department (R.I.P.D.), an agency that recruits deceased police officers to patrol the afterlife and capture &quot;Deados&quot;, spirits that failed to cross over and return to Earth as monstrous ghosts. Nick agrees to join the R.I.P.D. after Proctor explains that it would stave off a potentially negative final judgment for at least a century, and meets his new partner, Roy Pulsipher, an ex-U.S. Marshal who lived in the 1800s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cba6764cd57d220d0aaf3bbffb13afdc0329c04","amp;dn":"R.I.P.D.+%282013%29+%28HDRip.480p.x264%29+DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cba6764cd57d220d0aaf3bbffb13afdc0329c04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,186,103,100,205,87,210,32,208,170,243,187,255,177,58,253,192,50,156,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
