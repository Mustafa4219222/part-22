After a failed hit attempt against him and his family at a barbecue, he snitches on the Don Luchese (sending him to prison, where his influence allows him to live well) and enters the witness protection program under the supervision of FBI Agent Stansfield (Tommy Lee Jones). The family is once again re-locating to a small town near Normandy after their mafia tendencies alert the kingpin to their location.\n\nAs the family adjusts to life in the small city, each family member breaks off into their own stories occurring in parallel. Giovanni runs into trouble when he claims to be a history author writing a novel on the Normandy landings, which is problematic as many citizens in the area are much more familiar with the event than himself. He also begins a quest to track down why the water in his house is brown, becoming irritated when no one he talks to will take responsibility. He beats a plumber who tries to shake him down and a local fertilizer factory owner who interrupts him while talking.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c376458fa9c4f2ccd1127a2fda48236466d58929","amp;dn":"The+Family+TSCamRip.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c376458fa9c4f2ccd1127a2fda48236466d58929","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,118,69,143,169,196,242,204,209,18,122,47,218,72,35,100,102,213,137,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
