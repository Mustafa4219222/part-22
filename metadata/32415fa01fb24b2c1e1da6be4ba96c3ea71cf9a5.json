By 1971, Fassbinder was up to his 10th feature, and if the Godard influence on Beware of a Holy Whore is just as strong, Fassbinder expertly reworks Contempt to serve his own needs. Though it's ostensibly about filmmaking, more than half the film goes by before you see a camera (compare to Contempt, which features a camera in the first shot); what Fassbinder's really interested in are the dynamics of a group of brittle temperaments confined to an enclosed space (in this case, a Spanish hotel) for weeks at a time. The results, as you'd imagine, aren't pretty, with couples uncoupling and re-coupling without provocation (most notably, Hanna Schygulla makes nice with Alphaville's Eddie Constantine), broken glasses, bloodied egos and more temper tantrums than you can shake a Xanax at. And yet, Fassbinder almost dares you to be bored, keeping the camera distant and letting the pauses linger. By the time it's done, you may feel like climbing the walls, but you'll be fascinated all the same. ...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067962/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067962/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32415fa01fb24b2c1e1da6be4ba96c3ea71cf9a5","amp;dn":"Fassbinder+-+Warnung+vor+einer+heiligen+Nutte+%2F+Beware+of+a+Holy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32415fa01fb24b2c1e1da6be4ba96c3ea71cf9a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,65,95,160,31,178,75,44,30,29,166,190,75,169,108,62,167,28,249,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
