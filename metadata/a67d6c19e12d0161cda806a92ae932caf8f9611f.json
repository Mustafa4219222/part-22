And in one suburban neighborhood, a weird event in a dark alley leads to the revelation of a secret the world isn't ready to learn. A massive blood spill reveals the existence of something previously unknown-a person or a thing that lives on mass quantities of blood of all different ages and types. Robert Bellarmine is the man who sees this picture taking shape, and when a little neighborhood boy goes missing, Bellarmine knows it's only a matter of time before the boy becomes the next victim of a blood-hungry monster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a67d6c19e12d0161cda806a92ae932caf8f9611f","amp;dn":"The+Cleaners+03+%28of+04%29+%282009%29+%28Minutemen-DTs%26Xer%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a67d6c19e12d0161cda806a92ae932caf8f9611f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,125,108,25,225,45,1,97,205,168,6,169,42,233,50,202,248,249,97,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
