Tess ends up meeting Brooklyn Roebuck unexpectedly.\n\n\nSpecial Guests: Brooklyn Roebuck\n\n\nOriginal airdate: July 23, 2013\n\n------------------\n\nThere's some confusion about the Life With Boys episodes that aired on July 23 and July 30. They were BOTH named 'Let's Duet with Boys&quot;... although after watching the episodes, I think the July 30 episode should have a different name.\n\nSomeone listed them on Wikipedia as part one and part two, but left them both labelled as S02E13. They are clearly 2 separate episodes, so I am labeling the July 30 episode as S02E14.\n\nThere's no OFFICIAL episode listing on the web for this show. The YTV website is useless. Even websites like tvrage and epguides are currently only listing season 1 (and one episode of season 2).\n\nPerhaps down the road the confusion will clear up, and the July 30 episode will be listed with a different title. But for now, I am uploading them as S02E13 and S02E14, labelled Lets Duet With Boys part 1 and part 2, in the order that they aired.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebae924e2860b6c0ab6a03cccec9bb08af90a001","amp;dn":"Life.With.Boys.S02E13.HDTV.x264-CLDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebae924e2860b6c0ab6a03cccec9bb08af90a001","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,174,146,78,40,96,182,192,171,106,3,204,206,201,187,8,175,144,160,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
