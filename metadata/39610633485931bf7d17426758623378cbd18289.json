It looks at works of artists, scientists, Popes, emperors, ...    Full Descriptionkings, Freemasons, Knights Templar, and more. This visually stunning travelogue examines the intrigue in baroque and renaissance Rome and the implications it holds for us today.\n\nThis documentary questions the theories laid out in Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE by building upon the theories proposed in Simon Cox's book, CRACKING THE DA VINCI CODE. Based on Cox's follow-up bestseller, ILLUMINATING ANGELS AND DEVILS, the program explores the truths and fictions of Brown's &quot;Path of Illumination,&quot; going back as far as Renaissance-era Rome. In addition to providing insight into Brown's novel, ILLUMINATING ANGELS AND DEVILS also brings Roman history vividly to life.\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Dave Hoffman\n-------------------------\n\n\nTitle: Illuminating Angels And Demons\nYear:  2005\nFile Size: 700 MB \nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 01:30:51\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Resolution: 480x256\nVIdeo Bitrate: 1078 kbit/s\nFPS:  29.970000\nAudio Bitrate: 192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: (AC3)\nChannels:  2 \nSubtitles: (N/A)\n \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0766214/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0766214/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                             *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39610633485931bf7d17426758623378cbd18289","amp;dn":"Illuminating+Angels+And+Demons-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39610633485931bf7d17426758623378cbd18289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,97,6,51,72,89,49,191,125,23,66,103,88,98,51,120,203,209,130,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
