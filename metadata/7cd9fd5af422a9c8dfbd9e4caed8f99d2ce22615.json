But it is indeed a heavenly drop at that, since Perkins is so obviously comfortable here. Among the highlights are versions of &quot;Sitting on Top of the World,&quot; with longtime friend Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith on vocals, and &quot;Since I Fell for You,&quot; featuring the soulful voice of Otis Clay. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - 44 Blues\n02 - 4 O'Clock in the Morning\n03 - Relaxin'\n04 - Sitting On Top of the World\n05 - Just Keep On Drinking\n06 - Since I Fell For You\n07 - Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\n08 - Ida B\n09 - Sweet Home Chicago\n10 - Pinetop's Blues\n11 - Willow Weep For Me\n12 - That's All Right\n\nEnjoy and share!
