With no trial or any recourse, Sandra is sent to a womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prison with subpar living conditions and is terrorized by the other inmates. Meanwhile, SandraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter Tammi (Cook) is vigilantly working on getting her mother released from prison with limited knowledge of the laws and legal processes of Ecuador. Unwavering in her belief of her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innocence, Tammi is forced to drain her life savings while fighting with embassies and governments as she races against time to save her mother. In TammiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined fight for justice, she recruits a U.S. Congresswoman, Rep. Corinne Brown, and together they prevail in securing Sandra ChaseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release. \n\n\nCasT:\n\nBarbara Hershey as Sandra Chase\n\nRachael Leigh Cook as Tammi Chase \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c642fe3a6aadfe2569c98adb71d222bfb5e271","amp;dn":"Lifetime-Left+To+Die+%5B2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c642fe3a6aadfe2569c98adb71d222bfb5e271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,198,66,254,58,106,173,254,37,105,201,138,219,113,210,34,191,181,226,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
