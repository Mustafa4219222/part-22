The album was recorded at three live shows, one in Chicago and two in Toronto, in the spring of 2004. Guest musicians include The Sadies, Carolyn Mark, Kelly Hogan and Jon Rauhouse, and the album was produced by Case and Darryl Neudorf.\n\nAt the end of &quot;Train From Kansas City&quot;-- a track on Neko Case's new live album, The Tigers Have Spoken-- a lone voice, low and slightly garbled, yells &quot;We still love you!&quot; It's unclear what Case had done to warrant the &quot;still&quot;-- perhaps a gaffe earlier in the show-- but amid the between-song chaos this declaration goes unanswered if not completely unnoticed. It's difficult to believe that Case isn't used to such public pronouncements of affection and devotion by now; you could tape any of her live shows and probably hear someone scream something similar.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/20/neko-case/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/20/neko-case/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027e53fea7864010a2e2b2eff958d0766131538e","amp;dn":"Neko+Case...The+Tigers+Have+Spoken%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027e53fea7864010a2e2b2eff958d0766131538e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,126,83,254,167,134,64,16,162,226,178,239,249,88,208,118,97,49,83,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
