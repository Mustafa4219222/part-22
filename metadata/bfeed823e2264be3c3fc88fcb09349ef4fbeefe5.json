Born Gaynor Hopkins, she is recognisable by her highly distinctive, husky voice.\nBorn to a family that included three sisters and two brothers, her father worked in a coal mine and her mother (an opera lover) shared her love for music with her children. She grew up listening to Motown music and female artists like Janis Joplin and Tina Turner.\nIn 1970, at age 19, she entered a talent contest, singing Mary HopkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hit &quot;Those Were the Days,&quot; but only came in second place. She then was chosen to sing in a band with front man, Bobby Wayneand were known as Bobby Wayne &amp; The Dixies. Two years later, she formed her own band called Imagination and performed with them in pubs and clubs all over south Wales. It was then that she decided to adopt the stage name of Sherene Davies (she took these names from her niece and favorite aunt).\nIn 1973, she married Robert Sullivan, a real estate speculator. In 1975, she was discovered by Roger Bell, who arranged a recording contract for her with RCA Records. Before signing, she was asked to choose a different stage name, a process through which she finally became known as Bonnie Tyler.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfeed823e2264be3c3fc88fcb09349ef4fbeefe5","amp;dn":"Bonnie+Tyler-1977-1992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfeed823e2264be3c3fc88fcb09349ef4fbeefe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,238,216,35,226,38,75,227,195,252,136,252,176,147,73,239,79,190,239,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
