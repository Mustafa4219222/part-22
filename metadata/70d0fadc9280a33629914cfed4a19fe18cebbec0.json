Instead, the brothers sell the terrified boy into slavery in Egypt. But Joseph turns this agonizing betrayal into triumph.\r\n\r\nAcademy Award Ã‚Â® winners Ben Kingsley and Martin Landau highlight an outstanding cast in this beloved Biblical tale of treachery and redemption. Joseph uses his gift for divining dreams to rise from slave to Pharaoh's most trusted aide, saving Egypt from seven years of famine. Then his brothers travel to Egypt in search of food... and right into Joseph's power. &quot;Forgiveness is greater than vengeance,&quot; Joseph declares. &quot;Compassion more powerful than anger.&quot; But can he forgive so grievous a wrong?
