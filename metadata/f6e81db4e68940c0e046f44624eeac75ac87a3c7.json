There was no way to walk around freely.\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\nBurn With Alcohol 120% (Included in Download).\n\nSet DataType to Playstation (Write Method Raw/Dao) and burn at 8x speed.\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden CD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't working.\n\n\n(No CD-RW will not work).\n\n\nAny Problems or Questions Please Post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7 do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e81db4e68940c0e046f44624eeac75ac87a3c7","amp;dn":"%5BPsx%5D+Fighting+Force+%5BNtsc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e81db4e68940c0e046f44624eeac75ac87a3c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,232,29,180,230,137,64,192,224,70,244,70,36,238,172,117,172,135,163,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
