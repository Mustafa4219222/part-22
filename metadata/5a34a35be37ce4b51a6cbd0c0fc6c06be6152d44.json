When the Sweden Rock Magazine asked them about playing &quot;old school&quot;, they answered that heavy metal is not old school, it is timeless.\n\nThey released their first album, Into the Night, through the Heavy Artillery label in November 2008\n\nEnforcer released its second full length album &quot;Diamonds&quot; under Earache Records, on May the 24th, 2010 in Europe while Heavy Artillery Records released the album in North America on May 25, 2010.\n\nOn February the 1st, 2013 they released &quot;Death By Fire&quot; in Stockholm, Sweden. They headlined a Belgian release show along with Evil Invaders on February the 2nd, a Belgian speed metal band that released their self-titled EP.\n\nEnforcer is considered a part of the New Wave Of Traditional Heavy Metal (NWOTHM) an ongoing movement that in recent years has seen the return of traditional sounding metal bands (similar to the Swedish Sleaze metal revival) the name is taken from the New wave of british heavy metal in which the movement strongly identifies with.\n \nOther bands considered part of the movement include Steelwing, White Wizzard, Cauldron, Holy Grail, Skull Fist and more recently Sons of Lioth.\n\n       Japanese Edition \n\n1. \tDestroyer \t        03:41 \t\n2. \tUndying Evil \t        03:52 \t \n3. \tFrom Beyond \t        03:22 \t  \n4. \tOne with Fire \t        02:52 \t  \n5. \tBelow the Slumber \t06:21 \t \n6. \tHungry They Will Come \t04:32 \t  instrumental\n7. \tThe Banshee \t        04:17 \t \n8. \tFarewell \t        04:12 \t  \n9. \tHell Will Follow \t03:19 \t  \n10. \tMask of Red Death \t06:12 \t \n11. \tBursting Out (Venom cover) \t            02:35 \t \n12. \tI Turned Into a Martian (Misfits cover) \t01:38 \t \n13. \tMean Machine (Motorhead cover) \t           02:53 \t \n  \t49:46 \t \n\n\n\nMembers\n\n    Olof Wikstrand - vocals, guitar\n    Jonas Wikstrand - drums\n    Joseph Tholl - guitar\n    Tobias Lindqvist - bass\n\nPast members:\n\n    Adam Zaars - guitar (2006-2011)\n    Jakob Ljungberg - drums (2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a34a35be37ce4b51a6cbd0c0fc6c06be6152d44","amp;dn":"Enforcer+-+From+Beyond+%28Japanese+Edition%29+2015++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a34a35be37ce4b51a6cbd0c0fc6c06be6152d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,52,163,91,227,124,228,181,26,108,189,12,15,198,192,107,230,21,45,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
