No Jefferson Airplane or Scott McKenzie but there is a Mamas &amp; the Papas and a very nice mix of classic pop &amp; rock hits from that year, from Jesse Colin Young to the Monkees, that capture the spirit. This one makes a good start... one of those &quot;you didn't really have to be there&quot; to get it.\nA nice companion to the PBS documentary, &quot;The Summer of Love&quot;.\nTune in, turn on, drop out. And don't bogart that joint.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/a1aaa609-2257-4d1e-85a5-9c0ecb7a0938&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/a1aaa609-2257-4d1e-85a5-9c0ecb7a0938&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Love&lt;/a&gt;\n\n01.
