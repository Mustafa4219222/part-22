It kicks off with the original version of Atomic Power by the Buchanan Brothers that walks a fine line between Western swing, hillbilly boogie, and proto-bluegrass vocal harmonies. Of course, Bob Wills was still at the pinnacle of his mighty run and is represented here by New Spanish Two Step and Stay a Little Longer. Eddy Arnold's classic charting That's How Much I Love You is in this mix, as is Bill Monroe's Kentucky Waltz, with entries by Merle Travis, Gene Autry, the Delmore Brothers, Al Dexter with his groovy Wine, Women and Song, and Cowboy Copas' Tragic Romance. Some of the true standouts, though, are reserved for Hank Penny's Steel Guitar Stomp, Spade Cooley's Three Way Boogie, and Grandpa Jones' Eight More Miles to Louisville. The sound quality is not to be beat, making this an essential collection if there ever was one. \n(Thom Jurek)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Dim Lights, Thick Smoke And Hillbilly Music 1946\n(Bear Family Records 2008)\n\n     1.
