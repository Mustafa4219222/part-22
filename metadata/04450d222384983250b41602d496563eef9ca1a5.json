Ready to live life her own way and to experience things she's only ever heard of from the jarheads in her father's unit, she's on her way to college at San Diego State University.\n\nThanks to her new roommate, Harper is introduced to a world of parties, gorgeous guys, family, and emotions. She finds herself being torn in two as she quickly falls in love with both her new boyfriend, Brandon, and her roommate's brother, Chase. Despite their dangerous looks and histories, both men adore Harper and would do anything for her, including taking a step back if it would mean she'd be happy.\n\n\nabout author :-\n\nMolly grew up in California but now lives in the oh-so-amazing state of Texas with her husband and furry four-legged daughter. Some of her hobbies include hiking, snowboarding, traveling and long walks on the beachÃ¢â‚¬Â¦which roughly translates to being a homebody with her hubby and dishing out movie quotes. When sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not diving into the world of her characters, she can be found hiding out in her bedroom surrounded by her laptop, cell, Kindle and fighting over the TV remote. She has a weakness for crude-humored movies, fried pickles and loves curling up in a fluffy comforter during a thunderstorm...or under one in a bathtub if there are tornados. That way she can pretend they aren't really happening.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1349213522p8/6436698.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1349213522p8/6436698.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04450d222384983250b41602d496563eef9ca1a5","amp;dn":"taking+chance+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04450d222384983250b41602d496563eef9ca1a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,69,13,34,35,132,152,50,80,180,22,2,212,150,86,62,239,156,161,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
