This concert covers an incredibly diverse selection of repertoire, representing David's love for many genres and his remarkable ability to tackle each with unsurpassed enthusiasm. Michael Jackson's &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; is cleverly reinterpreted, as is Queen's ballad, &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever.&quot; AC/DC's &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is given a memorable new twist, alongside &quot;He's a Pirate&quot; from &quot;Pirates of the Carribean.&quot; Given his enduring commitment to his first musical love, watch as David performs classical selections including the last movement of Vivaldi's &quot;Summer&quot; from The Four Seasons, and Bach's &quot;Air.&quot; Not to be satisfied with only imaginative covers, David also displays his own deft writing skills with notable originals, including &quot;Chelsea Girl.&quot;\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fd97fb8417946a736fc06dc13386a7bf9d26d71","amp;dn":"David+Garrett%3A+Live+In+Berlin+%282009%29-sdtv+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fd97fb8417946a736fc06dc13386a7bf9d26d71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,217,127,184,65,121,70,167,54,252,6,220,19,56,106,123,249,210,109,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
