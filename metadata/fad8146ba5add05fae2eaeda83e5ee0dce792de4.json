Skeeter (Emma Stone) has just graduated from college, and she's eager to launch her career as a writer. In a moment of inspiration, Skeeter decides to focus her attention on the black female servants who work in her community. Her first subject is Aibileen (Viola Davis), the devoted housekeeper who has been employed by Skeeter's best friend's family for years. By speaking with Aibileen, Skeeter becomes an object of scorn to the wealthy locals, who view her actions as directly challenging to the established social order. Before long, even more servants are coming forward to tell their stories, and Skeeter discovers that friendship can blossom under the most unlikely of circumstances. Bryce Dallas Howard co-stars in a touching tale of race relations based on author Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel of the same name. \n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 2 Hours 26 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 1280\n\nFrame Height: 688\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 115kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fad8146ba5add05fae2eaeda83e5ee0dce792de4","amp;dn":"The+Help%282011%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fad8146ba5add05fae2eaeda83e5ee0dce792de4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,216,20,107,165,173,208,95,174,46,174,218,131,229,238,13,206,121,45,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
