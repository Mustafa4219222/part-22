Three short years transformed Romero, archbishop of San Salvador, from a conservative defender of the status quo into one of the churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most outspoken voices of the oppressed. Though silenced by an assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullet, his spiritÃ¢â‚¬â€and the challenge of his life lives on.\n\nReview\nOscar Romero was converted by suffering: the suffering of a friend, of the people he served, and then finally his own suffering. There are many ways to be converted, but perhaps the best way is to live among the poor and to discover in them as Romero did, the presence of Christ. -- Samuel Ruiz Garcia, Bishop of San Cristobal, Chiapas Mexico\n\nRomero does not speak from a distance. He does not hide his fears, his brokenness, his hesitations. It is as if he puts his arm around my shoulder and slowly walks with me. He shares my struggles. There is a warmth in his words that opens my heart to listen. -- Henri J. M. Nouwen, from the Forward\n\nThese homilies reveal lines of poetic beauty describing a cruel and ugly world Here is indomitable courage and utter humility. Here is a message of hope. --Robert McAfee Brown, Professor Emeritus, Pacific School of Religion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:394bfccfd36896c917bf03ea59e9c195412c4140","amp;dn":"The+Violence+of+Love+by+Don+Oscar+A.+Romero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"394bfccfd36896c917bf03ea59e9c195412c4140","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,75,252,207,211,104,150,201,23,191,3,234,89,233,193,149,65,44,65,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
