Fixed by the gaming community.  This version includes all the patches (official &amp; unoffical) as well as the widescreen resolution patcher.  This patcher is included in the &quot;Bin&quot; folder, a file called &quot;vtmbrespatcher.exe&quot;.  This will allow you to patch the game to run at your LCD&amp;#039;s native widescreen resolution.  Anyway, enjoy!  DAMN Activision for making them release this early.  It could have been the mother of all RPG&amp;#039;s!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c32409a0d9429401e373053a8b52fe9a90bc9bc5","amp;dn":"Vampire+-+Bloodlines+%28BEEWAA%21+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c32409a0d9429401e373053a8b52fe9a90bc9bc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,36,9,160,217,66,148,1,227,115,5,58,139,82,254,154,144,188,155,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
