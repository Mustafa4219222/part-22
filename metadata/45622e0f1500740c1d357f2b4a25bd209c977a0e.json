Bush administration during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In interviews with key administration officials, military leaders, and reporters from The Washington Post, the documentary examines how a secretary of defense bent on reform became a secretary of war accused of ignoring the advice of his generals.\n\n&quot;He came in determined to reassert civilian control over the Joint Staff and the rest of the military and it was a pretty tough process, a lot of friction in those first months, with Rumsfeld saying, `No, I don&amp;#039;t think you heard me clearly. I&amp;#039;m the boss. I want it this way,&amp;#039;&quot; reporter Thomas Ricks of The Washington Post tells FRONTLINE.\n\nIn the early months of the Bush administration, Rumsfeld saw his biggest enemy as the outdated Cold War thinking of the troops he commanded. &quot;Donald Rumsfeld wanted to build a smaller, nimbler, and more networked military that could respond swiftly to threats anywhere in the world. He came into the Defense Department where the forces were heavy and slow, took months to deploy and worked best when used in massive numbers,&quot; says Professor John Arquilla of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California.\n\nFormer Secretary of the Army Thomas White says that when Rumsfeld tried to push for a reduction in the number of troops in the army, the secretary found himself clashing with General Eric Shinseki, the army&amp;#039;s respected Chief of Staff. \n\nMore info: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/pentagon/\n\nAVI File Details\n=====================================================================================\nName.........: PBS Frontline (Oct 2004) Rumsfeld&amp;#039;s War (Divx 1h24m) ConRes.avi\nFilesize.....: 404 MB (or 414,717 KB or 424,670,842 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:23:56 (150,933 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DX50/DIVX\nVideo Bitrate: 603 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 64 kb/s (32/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 352x256 (1.38:1) [=11:8]\nRipper ......: p2P2p\n\nPeace :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracyresearch.org&lt;/a&gt; (Forums, Wiki, Blogs) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://conspiracycentral.net:6969&lt;/a&gt; (Educational Tracker)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45622e0f1500740c1d357f2b4a25bd209c977a0e","amp;dn":"PBS+Frontline+%28Oct+2004%29+Rumsfeld%5C%27s+War+%28DivX+1h24m%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45622e0f1500740c1d357f2b4a25bd209c977a0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,98,46,15,21,0,116,12,29,53,127,43,74,37,189,32,156,151,122,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
