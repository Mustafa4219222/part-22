This monograph is intended to\nhelp bound the problem in order to aid policy and resource decisions\nabout one type of potential threat to the homeland: cruise missiles\nand unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Importantly, the methodology\nused can be applied to other modes of attack, and the insights gained\nfrom this methodology extend to other threats as well. The focus of\nthe research is on a specific class of weapons, but those weapons are\nnot assessed in isolation; rather, it considers class of weapons as one of\nmany options open to a potential attacker and seeks to identify investment\nstrategies that are effective against multiple threats.WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAP!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4121be0371c3cb65cd93ebc5a3711bcba266f656","amp;dn":"Evaluating+Novel+Threats+To+The+Homeland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4121be0371c3cb65cd93ebc5a3711bcba266f656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,33,190,3,113,195,203,101,205,147,235,197,163,113,27,203,162,102,246,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
