Followers flock to her Kildare abbey and scriptorium. Hearing accounts of BrigidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power, the Church deems her a threat and sends Decius, a Roman priest and scribe, on a secret mission to collect proof of BrigidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heresy.\n\nAs Decius records the unorthodox practices of Brigid and her abbey, he becomes intrigued by her. When Brigid assigns Decius a holy taskÃ¢â‚¬â€to create the most important and sacred manuscript ever madeÃ¢â‚¬â€he finds himself at odds with his original mission and faces the most difficult decision of his life.\n\nModern day: Alexandra Patterson, an appraiser of medieval relics, has been summoned to Kildare to examine a reliquary box believed to belong to Saint Brigid. Hidden within the sacred box is the most beautiful illuminated manuscript Alex has ever seen. But even more extraordinary is the contents of the manuscriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vellum pages, which may have dire repercussions for the Catholic Church and could very well rewrite the origins of Christianity.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:976c1a06380d2dee5cdbaac602a7feddc60c0ac6","amp;dn":"Brigid+of+Kildare+by+Heather+Terrell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"976c1a06380d2dee5cdbaac602a7feddc60c0ac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,108,26,6,56,13,45,238,92,219,170,198,2,167,254,221,198,12,10,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
