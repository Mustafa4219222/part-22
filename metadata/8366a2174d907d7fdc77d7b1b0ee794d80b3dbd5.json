Wang, Chih Ted Yang \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 866 pages \r\nPublisher: Humana Press; 2014 edition (January 11, 2014) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9781627035941 \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of Environmental Engineering series is an incredible collection of methodologies that study the effects of pollution and waste in their three basic forms: gas, solid, and liquid. This exciting new addition to the series, Volume 15: Modern Water Resources Engineering , has been designed to serve as a water resources engineering reference book as well as a supplemental textbook. We hope and expect it will prove of equal high value to advanced undergraduate and graduate students, to designers of water resources systems, and to scientists and researchers. A critical volume in the Handbook of Environmental Engineering series, chapters employ methods of practical design and calculation illustrated by numerical examples, include pertinent cost data whenever possible, and explore in great detail the fundamental principles of the field. Volume 15: Modern Water Resources Engineering, provides information on some of the most innovative and ground-breaking advances in the field today from a panel of esteemed experts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8366a2174d907d7fdc77d7b1b0ee794d80b3dbd5","amp;dn":"Modern+Water+Resources+Engineering+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8366a2174d907d7fdc77d7b1b0ee794d80b3dbd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,102,162,23,77,144,125,127,220,119,215,177,176,238,121,77,128,179,219,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
