The fact that this source needed correction was determined\nby comparing it with an online keyboard (ITypeMusic), the exact\nstretch ratio was determined by comparing the relative lengths of\nJohnny B. Goode from this source and the AUD onthe ratio\nwas confirmed by comparing various tones generated in CE2K (used as a\n&quot;tuning fork&quot;) with the playback in CE Pro of several corrected\ntracks.  The frequencies for various notes used for comparison were\nfound at http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html.\n\nI redid the patch in Let it Grow, adjusting for pitch and volume.  I\nwould have redone the patch in Drums, but for some reason could not\nget the patch to match up once I'd pitch-corrected the nonpatch\nsections of that track, so I decided to leave it.  I think doing the\npitch correction helps reinvigorate the energy of this excellent show.\nSHNs were converted to FLAC and shntool used to clean up SBEs.\n\nBill Tetzeli\n10:06 AM 7/2/2006\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhen this source was first circulated, the flac files contained\nREPLAYGAIN tags. The wav files compressed inside the flac files are\nfine, but if you listen to the flac files themselves using a player\nlike WinAMP, these tags cause all the tracks to be played at the same\nvolume. That's not good for concerts where some tracks are supposed to\nbe louder than others.\n \nThere's a new version of this source available. It has exactly the\nsame wav files; it's just the flac wrapper that's different, the\nwrapper doesn't have REPLAYGAIN set anymore. The new version has the\nsame ffp file (since the wav's are the same), but a new md5 file\n(since the flac files are different). The md5 file for the old source\nis called &quot;orig-flac-replaygain-md5&quot;; the md5 file for the good new\nsource is called &quot;flac-md5&quot;. If you have a source for this that\nmatches the ffp, you can create the new source by unflac'ing the old\nsource and then recompressing at flac level 8 using the flac command\nline tool or the flac frontend.\n \nFrom now on, only the new version of the source should be circulated.\n\nSteveSw - Nov, 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e145f66abe40c378a2e811c88ead4b1d5a63749","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1980-06-20+-+West+High+Aud+in+Anchorage%2C+AK++SBD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e145f66abe40c378a2e811c88ead4b1d5a63749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,20,95,102,171,228,12,55,138,46,129,28,136,234,212,177,213,166,55,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
