Soviet and Russian combat aircraft generally have a well-earned reputation as capable fighting machines - a reputation due in no small part to the punch they pack. This new book examines the development of different classes of weapons carried by Soviet/Russian aircraft. One chapter is devoted to cannons, while others deal with missiles developed by various design bureaux, including the now-famous Vympel, Raduga and Zvezda companies - air-to-air missiles, covering the period from the very basic RS-1-US of the early 1960s to the latest 'fire and forget' R-77 (RVV-AE) featuring active radar homing, and air-to-surface missiles from the Mikoyan KS-1 anti-shipping missile of the mid-1950s to 'smart weapons' of today, such as the laser-guided Raduga Kh-29L and TV-guided Kh-29T. Due attention is also paid to unguided rockets, bombs (including guided bombs) and assorted gun pods, submunitions dispensers and podded target designator/guidance systems associated with some of the air-to-ground munitions.\n\nAmazon.com title link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Russian-Aircraft-Weapons-Since/dp/1857801881&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Soviet-Russian-Aircraft-Weapons-Since/dp/1857801881&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8d373ad501175a3e9b6ead07adea50f690af5ea","amp;dn":"Soviet%2FRussian+Aircraft+Weapons%3A+Since+World+War+Two","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8d373ad501175a3e9b6ead07adea50f690af5ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,211,115,173,80,17,117,163,233,182,234,208,122,222,165,15,105,10,245,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
