Murr (Springer, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-3-319-01814-0\r\n\r\nThis extensive knowledge base provides a coherent description of advanced topics in materials science and engineering with an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary approach. The book incorporates a historical account of critical developments and the evolution of materials fundamentals, providing an important perspective for materials innovations, including advances in processing, selection, characterization, and service life prediction. It includes the perspectives of materials chemistry, materials physics, engineering design, and biological materials as these relate to crystals, crystal defects, and natural and biological materials hierarchies, from the atomic and molecular to the macroscopic, and emphasizing natural and man-made composites. This expansive presentation of topics explores interrelationships among properties, processing, and synthesis (historic and contemporary). The book serves as both an authoritative reference and roadmap of advanced materials concepts for practitioners, graduate-level students, and faculty coming from a range of disciplines","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b6649cdd24b12b0e18363c183c9088439134ca","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Materials+Structures%2C+Properties%2C+Processing+and+Per","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b6649cdd24b12b0e18363c183c9088439134ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,182,100,156,221,36,177,43,14,24,54,60,24,60,144,136,67,145,52,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
