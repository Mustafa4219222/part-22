The Gibsons have made a conscious effort to co-write most of the songs on this album. By using their own band and a single microphone for their duet vocals, you hear exactly what you hear in a live show: a tight ensemble that plays to the song, toneful and nuanced lead and duet harmonies, and songs that can move you to tears or to the dance floor.\n\n---------------------------\nARTiST: The Gibson Brothers\nALBUM: Iron &amp; Diamonds\nBiTRATE: 165kbps avg\nQUALiTY: EAC Secure Mode / LAME 3.97 Final / -V2 --vbr-new / 44.100Khz\nLABEL: Sugar Hill Records\nGENRE: Country\nSiZE: 48.14 megs\nPLAYTiME: 0h 38min 30sec total\nRiP DATE: 2008-04-29\nSTORE DATE: 2008-04-22\n\nTrack List:\n--------\n01.

Interspersed with original\nsongs like the title track- a snapshot of the miners&amp;#039; baseball team in their\nupstate-NY home- are carefully chosen covers like Tom Petty&amp;#039;s &quot;Cabin Down Below&quot;\nand others.\n\nThe album boasts the brothers&amp;#039; best vocal mix to date thanks to being able to\nrecord live on one mike, capturing the energy and closeness that concert\naudiences rave about. The band- Mike Barber on bass, Clayton Campbell on fiddle,\nand Rick Hayes on mandolin- is tighter than ever, complementing the brothers&amp;#039;\nharmonies with adept instrumental performances.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52f3fdcab0bdaf1e746064a47333753231f6385f","amp;dn":"The+Gibson+Bros-Iron+%26+Diamonds+%282008-VBR-Bluegrass%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52f3fdcab0bdaf1e746064a47333753231f6385f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,243,253,202,176,189,175,30,116,96,100,164,115,51,117,50,49,246,56,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
