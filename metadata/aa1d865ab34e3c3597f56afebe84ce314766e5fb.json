Ira Levin&amp;#039;s second novel (he went on to write such fine thrillers as A Kiss Before Dying, The Stepford Wives, and The Boys from Brazil), Rosemary&amp;#039;s Baby, remains perhaps his best work. The author&amp;#039;s mainstream &quot;this is how it really happened&quot; style undeniably also made the novel his most widely imitated. The plot line is deceptively simple: What if you were a happily married young woman, living in New York, and one day you awoke to find yourself pregnant? And what if your loving husband had--apparently--sold your soul to Satan? And now you were beginning to believe that your unborn child was, in reality, the son of Satan? Levin subtly makes it all totally plausible, unless of course, dear Rosemary--or the reader--can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality! A wonderfully chilling novel, it was later faithfully transformed into an equally unnerving motion picture. In 1997, a sequel was spawned, Son of Rosemary. [If anyone happens to have an audiobook of this sequel please upload!) \n\nWritten By Ira Levin.\nRead By Mia Farrow.\n\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa1d865ab34e3c3597f56afebe84ce314766e5fb","amp;dn":"Rosemarys+Baby+-+Rare+Audiobook+%5BUnabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa1d865ab34e3c3597f56afebe84ce314766e5fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,29,134,90,179,78,60,53,151,245,106,254,190,132,206,49,71,102,229,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
