And when, just a couple of weeks before Christmas, the immigration department gets wind of this, Angela needs to find a new job urgently. Or a husband. And she doesn't think her boyfriend Alex will be keen. A girls' weekend in Vegas with her best friend Jenny seems the perfect way to forget her troubles. From the minute they arrive Angela is swept up in a whirl of cocktails, outrageous outfits, late nights and brushes with the chapel of love. But rather than escaping trouble, Angela is up to her neck in it!. But what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas -- right? With a bonus Angela's Guide to Vegas - the ultimate city break guide!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17c2fab88921f6e4eda42436c21331b1b969e1d1","amp;dn":"Lindsey+Kelk+-+I+Heart+Vegas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17c2fab88921f6e4eda42436c21331b1b969e1d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,194,250,184,137,33,246,228,237,164,36,54,194,19,49,177,185,105,225,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
