Allen, &quot;Biophysical Chemistry&quot;\nWiley-Blackwell | 2008 | ISBN: 1405124369 | 512 pages | PDF \n\nThis text presents physical chemistry through the use of biological and biochemical topics, examples and applications to biochemistry. It lays out the necessary calculus in a step by step fashion for students who are less mathematically inclined, leading them through fundamental concepts, such as a quantum mechanical description of the hydrogen atom rather than simply stating outcomes. Techniques are presented with an emphasis on learning by analyzing real data.\n\nPresents physical chemistry through the use of biological and biochemical topics, examples and applications to biochemistry.\nLays out the necessary calculus in a step by step fashion for students who are less mathematically inclined.\nPresents techniques with an emphasis on learning by analyzing real data.\nFeatures qualitative and quantitative problems at the end of each chapter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa63b99c98c40e32247dd3bdfe29482002d64680","amp;dn":"Biophysical+Chemistry+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa63b99c98c40e32247dd3bdfe29482002d64680","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,99,185,156,152,196,14,50,36,125,211,189,254,41,72,32,2,214,70,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
