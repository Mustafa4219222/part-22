With 23 sets being manufactured in total by Metro-Cammell between 1957 and 1960, the Class 111 is typical of the small DMUs which provided passenger services on rural lines like The Granfield Branch. This pack also includes the Class 02 shunter and 8F steam locomotive and The Granfield Branch for you to run them on.\n\n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nJoin Railworks Central for more addons, support and discussions at:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor support and requests email:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;96e2f3f7fbe2e6f4a2f3e0f3e4d6f1fbf7fffab8f5f9fb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you want to say thanks, contribute and share an addon with the community then email them to us...
