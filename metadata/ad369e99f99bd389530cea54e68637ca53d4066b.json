She must lead an assault against the Federation world of Pyeongwha, where a terrible sociological phenomenon has unleashed hell against the civilian population. Then she faces the threat from a portion of League space known as New Torah, in which a ruthless regime of surviving corporations are building new synthetic soldiers but taking the technology in alarming directions.\n\nOn the Torahn world of Pantala, Sandy encounters betrayal, crisis, and conspiracy on a scale previously unimaginable. Most challenging of all, she also meets three young street kids who stir emotions in her she didn't think she was capable of. Can the Federation's most lethal killer afford unexpected sentiment? What will be the cost if she is forced to choose between them and her mission, not only to her cause, but to her soul?\n\n\n================\n\nFor more quality uploads, please visit my profile and my thread :\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Dovah-Mixed-Collection&lt;/a&gt;\n\n================\n\nDovah\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad369e99f99bd389530cea54e68637ca53d4066b","amp;dn":"Joel+Shepherd%2C+23+Years+on+Fire+%28Cassandra+Kresnov++4%29+epub%5Bdova","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad369e99f99bd389530cea54e68637ca53d4066b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,54,158,153,249,155,211,137,83,12,234,84,230,134,55,202,83,212,6,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
