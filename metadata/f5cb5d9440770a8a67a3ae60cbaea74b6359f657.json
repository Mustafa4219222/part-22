When the 1860 Republican National Convention chose Lincoln over three seasoned politicians, his rivals were shocked and humiliated. So how did an &quot;upstart bumpkin&quot; convince this disgruntled trio to join his team? And when they agreed, how did he reign in such political heavyweights? Displaying Liconln's disarming political savvy and sketching the fasicnating lives of four Presidential contenders, this riveting narrative reveals how brilliantly Lincoln handled his cabinet of Secretary of State William H. Seward, Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, Attorney General Edward Bates, and other former opponents.\n\nComplete Unabridged audiobook\nRunning time: 42 hours\nEncoding: 64kbps mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5cb5d9440770a8a67a3ae60cbaea74b6359f657","amp;dn":"Doris+Kearns+Goodwin+-+Team+of+Rivals+%5BComplete%2C+unabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5cb5d9440770a8a67a3ae60cbaea74b6359f657","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,203,93,148,64,119,10,138,103,163,174,96,203,174,167,75,99,89,246,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
