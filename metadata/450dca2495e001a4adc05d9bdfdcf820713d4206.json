It is titled after the main work, a six-movement suite for solo flute, piano and string orchestra, composed by Lord in memory of his close friend the late Sir John Mortimer, CBE, QC. The music emanates from that which Lord composed for the stage show, MortimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Miscellany, which he also occasionally accompanied. To Notice Such Things is the last line of the Thomas Hardy poem Ã¢â‚¬Å“AfterwardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which ended the show.\n\nJon says of the piece, &quot;I wanted to give the flute the job of speaking for John throughout the Suite; his laughter and his sighs, his wistfulness and occasional mild cantankerousness, his playfulness, and also the anguish and then the acceptance of his final days.&quot; The flute solo in the recording of To Notice Such Things, is performed by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic OrchestraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s principal flautist Cormac Henry, who throughout the work engages in dexterous musical dialogue with LordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s solo piano.\n\nJon Lord performed three movements from To Notice Such Things at MortimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memorial service at Southwark Cathedral in November 2009, in front of an audience that included the Duchess of Cornwall, members of the Mortimer family, Lord Mandelson, Lord Kinnock, Jeremy Paxman, Alan Rickman, Peter OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Toole, Sir Tom Stoppard and Jeremy Irons, whose noble reading of Ã¢â‚¬Å“AfterwardsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ closes the recording of To Notice Such Things.\n\nTo Notice Such Things has been performed live a few times, most notably on June 16, 2010 at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall with Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Clark Rundell.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n1. &quot;As I Walked Out One Evening&quot; (4:15)\n2. &quot;At Court&quot; (5:33)\n3. &quot;Turville Heath&quot; (3:01)\n4. &quot;The Stick Dance&quot; (4:45)\n5. &quot;The Winter of a Dormouse&quot; (5:33)\n6. &quot;Afterwards&quot; (3:56)\n7. &quot;Evening Song&quot; (8:16)\n8. &quot;For Example&quot; (9:12)\n9. &quot;Air on the Blue String&quot; (6:33)\n10. &quot;Afterwards&quot; (Poem by Thomas Hardy) (3:01)\n\nTracks 1-6: To Notice Such Things - In memoriam of Sir John Mortimer, CBE, QC (1923Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2009)\nTrack 7: Original vocal version appears on Jon Lord's Pictured Within album\nTrack 8: Dedicated to ÃƒËœyvind Gimse and The Trondheim Soloists\nTrack 9: Dedicated to Matthew Barley\nTrack 10: Read by Jeremy Irons w/Jon Lord, piano\nTotal time: 54:25","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:450dca2495e001a4adc05d9bdfdcf820713d4206","amp;dn":"Jon+Lord+-+To+Notice+Such+Things+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"450dca2495e001a4adc05d9bdfdcf820713d4206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,13,202,36,149,224,1,164,173,192,93,155,223,220,248,32,113,61,66,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
