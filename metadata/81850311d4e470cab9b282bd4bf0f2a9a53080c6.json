Structures as small as a garden shed and hard surfaces as massive as an arena parking lot each have an environmental effect through the loss of water as uncontained runoff. Rain gardening emphasizes the capture and reuse of water within residential and commercial landscapes by using such techniques as bioretention ponds, storm-water chains, green roofs, and permeable paving. In this unique and essential resource, Dunnett and Clayden expertly and comprehensively explain the various methods of creating rain-gardening systems in clear, precise, and enthusiastic language; augment their proposals with simple line drawings and color photographs; provide a concise directory of suitable plants; and draw on inspiring case histories of successful rain-garden projects throughout the U.S and Europe.
