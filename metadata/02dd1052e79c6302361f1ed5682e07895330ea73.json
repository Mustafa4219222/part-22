The stories were not treated as crossovers and the Batman titles continued as they had before Knightfall where the creative teams each pursued its own storyline. Instead of a crossover, Knightquest was more of an umbrella title that also encompassed some issues of Shadow of the Bat.  \n\nThis is not a complete Knightquest storyline, only the first half since as I already said, I'm uploading storylines chronologically py plot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02dd1052e79c6302361f1ed5682e07895330ea73","amp;dn":"15.Knightquest+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02dd1052e79c6302361f1ed5682e07895330ea73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,221,16,82,231,156,99,2,54,31,30,213,104,46,7,137,83,48,234,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
