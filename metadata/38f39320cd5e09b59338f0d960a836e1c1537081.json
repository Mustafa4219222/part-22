If not, no harm done to your computer.\n\nPowerDirector 10 comes with H264 and MPEG codecs, but since they have to be activated and every serial seemed to have a limited amount of activations they simply ran out after a while. Then I made some changes in the Windows Registry. The changes resets the 30 day trial of the codecs, so every 30 days or whenever you feel like, you just have to run the two .reg files included in this download to reset the trial.\n\n\nInstructions:\n1. Install Cyberlink PowerDirector 10\n2. Install update (included in CORE's release)\n3. Start PowerDirector and insert a serial (one included in this download)\n4. Enjoy the editing\n5. Run the two .reg files included in this download now and then to reset the 30 days trial of the H264 and MPEG codecs\n\n __________ \n\n.:goSierra:.\n __________ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f39320cd5e09b59338f0d960a836e1c1537081","amp;dn":"CyberLink.PowerDirector.Ultra.v10.0.Codec.Trial.Reset.ONLY-goSie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f39320cd5e09b59338f0d960a836e1c1537081","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,243,147,32,205,94,9,181,147,56,240,217,96,168,54,225,193,83,112,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
