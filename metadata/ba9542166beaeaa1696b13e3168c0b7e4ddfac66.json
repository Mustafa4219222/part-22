When two strange men in top hats disembark from their train, the hacks solicit them until they give in and ask for a ride to their castle. When the men stiff the fare, Tom and Jerry pursue them, only to be trapped inside the castle by a portcullis. They wander about the residence and encounter a fearsome-looking bat, a bathing, whistling skeleton, a veritable army of ghosts, and other assorted ghouls and goblins. After meeting a skeletal quartet in black-face, they find the two strange men again and discover they've been turned into skeletons as well, after which they escape the castle and run for their lives. \n\n\nDirectors:\nJohn Foster, Vernon Stallings (as Geo.
