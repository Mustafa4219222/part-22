In Anthony Burgess's nightmare vision of the future, where the criminals take over after dark, the story is told by the central character, Alex, who talks in a brutal invented slang that brilliantly renders his and his friends' social pathology. A Clockwork Orange is a frightening fable about good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. And when the state undertakes to reform Alex to &quot;redeem&quot; him, the novel asks, &quot;At what cost?&quot;\n\nThis edition includes the controversial last chapter not published in the first edition and Burgess's introduction &quot;A Clockwork Orange Resucked.&quot;\n\nAt the American publisher's insistence, Burgess allowed their editors to cut the redeeming final chapter from the U.S. version, so that the tale would end on a darker note, with Alex succumbing to his violent, reckless natureÃ¢â‚¬â€an ending which the publisher insisted would be 'more realistic' and appealing to a U.S. audience. The film adaptation, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is based on the American edition of the book (which Burgess considered to be &quot;badly flawed&quot;). Kubrick called Chapter 21 &quot;an extra chapter&quot; and claimed that he had not read the original version until he had virtually finished the screenplay, and that he had never given serious consideration to using it. In Kubrick's opinion, the final chapter was unconvincing and inconsistent with the book.\n\nMP3 @ 32 kbps \nLength - 6:43:47","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68b20f4799bd3c1463e18cf035e46c69f7c0d7db","amp;dn":"A+Clockwork+Orange+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68b20f4799bd3c1463e18cf035e46c69f7c0d7db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,178,15,71,153,189,60,20,99,225,140,240,53,228,108,105,247,192,215,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
