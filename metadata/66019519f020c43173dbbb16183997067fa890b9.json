The group was essentially Stone Temple Pilots with Coutts (formerly of the band Ten Inch Men) taking the place of Scott Weiland (now of Velvet Revolver), who was, around this time, working on solo material and struggling with drug addiction.\n\nTalk Show released their self-titled (and only) album on Atlantic Records in September 1997. Despite positive reviews and supporting tours with the Foo Fighters and Aerosmith, the album's sales were disappointing and deemed a commercial failure. With the lackluster sales, the DeLeos and Kretz re-emerged with Weiland as Stone Temple Pilots once again.\n\nAfter STP called it quits in 2003, the DeLeo brothers formed a band called Army of Anyone, with vocalist Richard Patrick (Filter) and drummer Ray Luzier (formerly of David Lee Roth's band).
