The original album was released in 1980 by Greensleves entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Big ShowdownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ featuring Jah Thomas and displaying a cartoon drawing of a boxing match between the two dub masters as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s album cover. Both of whom each mixed five tracks on the album. The album is rightly regarded as a classic and is seen by many as one of the last great dub albums.\n\n \n\nWhat many people didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t realize is that Junjo Lawes productions issued an entirely different version simultaneously in Jamaica on the Jah Guidance label. This album used the same sleeve and track listing as the original Greensleves version, but contained ten different Barrington Levy dubs, again mixed at King TubbyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s studio. Both recordings featured dubs of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Reggae MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Looking My LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Black Heart ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the other seven were never issued on an album and each mix on the Jah Guidance album is different from any other release ever issued in any format! These tunes have remained obscure and not available for 25 years, until nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n \n\nThe Lost Mixes opens with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Shaolin Temple DubÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and takes the listener on a tough, raw and to the point ride through JamaicaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s golden age of dub wise. Each track is dubbed to perfection, with tunes like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Trod with JahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ being turned into a stomping drum and bass workout. All the Levy killers are present from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Shine Eye GalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“A Yah We DehÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\n \n\nNo one really knows who exactly mixed down these tracks, the album notes say Scientist or Jammy are likely culprits! But whatever the case this is Barrington Levy and The Roots Radics with a new twist of timeless dub!\n\nEAc log, cue, m3u &amp; images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1c7844939cfa371882eeec8d8fa01cc6d6913d8","amp;dn":"Barrington+Levy+-+In+Dub+The+Lost+Mixes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1c7844939cfa371882eeec8d8fa01cc6d6913d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,199,132,73,57,207,163,113,136,46,238,200,216,250,1,204,109,105,19,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
