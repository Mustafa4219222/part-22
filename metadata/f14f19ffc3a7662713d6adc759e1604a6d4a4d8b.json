It&amp;#039;s only appropriate that New Orleans also make its contribution in the form of drummer Stanton Moore, \na viciously adept guardian of the groove. The year-old addition of percussionist/vibist Mike Dillon represents an upgrade \non the original Trois of guitarist Charlie Hunter, saxophonist Skerik, and drummer Moore (who together recorded the Mysteryfunk \nEP in 1999).\n\nWhenever you have Charlie Hunter on the scene, certain things are bound to happen. Because of his frightening abilities on \nthe eight-string guitar (which also goes down to the lowest depths of the bass), he contributes two voices to the group. If \nyou spend too much time considering what he&amp;#039;s doing with his spidery hands, you might get distracted from the fact that he \nkeeps the bottom end tight and manly. Sure enough, Stanton Moore seizes the opportunity to lay down beats that draw direct \nfrom the source: snare-heavy, bouncing, and intensely focused on the backbeat.\n\nThe rest of the sound is a funk standby. Hunter&amp;#039;s high-end tone generally hovers between dirty guitar and lush organ, \ncomping unobtrusively during the buildup of a groove and laying out melody lines when the time is right. Skerik, whose \nother endeavors in this arena have been quite remarkable (see his Syncopated Taint Septet), absolutely never falls into \nthe usual funkster traps of monotonous repetition and unfocused riffing.\n\nThe five-minute ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLaunchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ illustrates what happens when the group goes full-bore. The basic groove emerges as a straightforward \nshuffle, but after a couple of reflective interludes Hunter throws his processor into the garbage disposer and goes intergalactic. \nAn extended noisy outburst, fueled from all four sides, explodes and combusts, leaving a post-apocalyptic calm that coalesces \nright back into the groove. Full circle, together then apart, Garage takes it home.\n\nTouches on mutant samba (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Gat SwambaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), funkadelic psychedelia (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½A-FrameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), a predictable torch song (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½We SeeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), bouncing \nHunterisms (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Sprung MonkeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), rock-tinged funk (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Delta SkeltaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), and instrumental jams round out the program. It&amp;#039;s an experimental \nendeavor without a doubt, and a far cry from the slicked-back funk package that pervades today&amp;#039;s marketplace. Provided you have \nan itch for the groove, don&amp;#039;t mind digging deep into the source, and enjoy the occasional trip out, Emphasizer is a sure winner. \nOtherwise handle with caution: this is heady stuff.\n\n(Trivia-seekers will delight in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgrundleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mentioned in the title of the third track. According to a reliable online source , \nthis noun refers to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe area between the pounder and the booty.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Just as well. Garage a Trois is nothing if not pure testosterone \nall the way.)
