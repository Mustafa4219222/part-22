A far cry from Steven Spielberg's Hook, director Damion Dietz taps into this seldom seen side of Pan in Neverland. When a seductive Peter Pan (Rick Sparks) and his vocally reluctant sidekick Tinkerbell (Kari Wahlgren) convince adopted siblings Wendy (Melany Bell), Michael (Marcus Reynaga), and John Darling (Wil Wheaton) to join him in Neverland, they had no idea that their destination was a deteriorating amusement park serving as home to scads of confused and startlingly attractive youths. Once there, the Darling family becomes victim to Chief Hook's (Gary Kelley) plot. Obsessed with the youth and beauty of Peter Pan, the disgruntled park maintenance man (Kelley) jumps at the opportunity to kidnap the lost boys after Tinkerbell reveals their location in a drug-induced stupor, realizing that only such an action would prompt a face-off with Peter.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img238.imageshack.us/img238/7615/ndvd157rv9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img238.imageshack.us/img238/7615/ndvd157rv9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img390.imageshack.us/img390/3715/ndvd160rx6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img390.imageshack.us/img390/3715/ndvd160rx6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/499/ndvd175sw1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img259.imageshack.us/img259/499/ndvd175sw1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------not my rip----------\n\n~~~~~~ Neverland.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................733,466,624                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.0.1              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:19:39                \nFrame Count:....................................143215             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................640                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................352                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.818                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................29.970          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1027                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.152&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2       \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
