Release: 2011\n\nBear FamilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2011 compilation Sugartime contains all of the songs Charlie Phillips released between 1957 and 1967, filling out the lengthy disc with some ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“70s recordings, demos, and unreleased songs. Phillips is known for writing the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“50s country standard ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSugartime,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ turned into a hit by the McGuire Sisters and recorded by Johnny Cash, but Bear FamilyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s compilation digs much deeper, deeper even than his own answer song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNo More Sugartime,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ rounding up his singles for Coral, Columbia, Longhorn, Reprise, and Artco. Phillips strolled a little sleepily through his early-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s sides yet there was charm to his gentle touch; he had a warm, easy voice and his songs were simple and sturdy, the latter turning out to be a strength as his music turned toward purer country as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s rolled on. While he never had a veiled threat of menace like some hardcore honky tonkers, his geniality was a perfect fit for Western swing and friendly dancehall two-steps, and his late-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s sides like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBig BallÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in Cowtown,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTwenty Fools Ago,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Blue BottleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are terrific genre pieces, the kind that should be found on a roadhouse jukebox. Phillips may not have defined his era, but listening to Sugartime itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possible to trace how the times shifted from the sweetness of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSugartimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the straight-ahead beer-joint tunes of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“60s, winding up with the mildly wacky novelty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re My LSD.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Although there may be a couple slow stretches along the way, this journey provided by Sugartime is definitely worth taking.
