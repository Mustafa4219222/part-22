And each will captain their negation and ridicule before eventually, on the third day, falling into some kind of teary and blissful acceptance.\n\nThis is a story of happiness, regardless of the hurt and suffering of which it is sometimes garbed.\n\nwww.cseanmcgee.com\n\nTheFreeArtCollection\n\nComing Soon:\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife\n\nRock Book Volume III: Still Life\n\nThrough The Multiverse\n\nTake Risk and Take Care,\n\nC.SeanMcGee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11634626d1cdb3b51880e140360caac62a6d67a","amp;dn":"Happy+People+Live+Here+%28Samsung+Galaxy%29+by+C.SeanMcGee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11634626d1cdb3b51880e140360caac62a6d67a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,22,52,98,109,28,219,59,81,136,14,20,3,96,202,172,98,166,214,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
