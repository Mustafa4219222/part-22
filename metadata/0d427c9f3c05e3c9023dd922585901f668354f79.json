ESR is targeted for companies, but\nis also free to use for home users. Very stable and reliable version of Firefox.\n \nEvery time when main release Firefox gets updates, ESR receives also all security\nand reliability related updates, but not the latest new features. New features ESR\nwill apply only once or twice in year. That makes ESR very reliable &amp; stable to use.\nFirefox ESR is My favourite choice of browsers. Have used since Firefox version 17.\n \n \nPortable: No installation needed. Extract 7-Zip file where ever You want and start using.\n \nAll settings already done. Ready to run. Only couple little tweaks done.\n \nYou could run this also from usb stick. ShouldnÃ‚Â´t write nothing to host machine.\n \nFully updateable. It asks, before update (settings = manual).\n \nInstalled couple of addons, wich improves security and usability. All setted up.\n \n \nIf You like this upload, please share it with others by seeding. Thank You.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d427c9f3c05e3c9023dd922585901f668354f79","amp;dn":"Firefox+ESR+31.1+Portable+%28en-us%29+%5BJUHAX69X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d427c9f3c05e3c9023dd922585901f668354f79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,66,124,159,60,5,227,201,2,61,217,34,88,89,1,246,104,53,79,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
