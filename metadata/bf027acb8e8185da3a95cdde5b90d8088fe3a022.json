Taking musical chances, however, always has been. While Kylesa are as heavy as any band out there, they are beholden to no one scene and no preconceived notions of what heavy music should be.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLots of people like to stick to one kind of music,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ guitarist/vocalist Philip Cope elaborates, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œand even with the underground, lots of people segregate themselves into small little categories and place lots of imaginary rules on these scenes.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe just like playing heavy music and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve always liked playing it regardless of what is popular or trendy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ guitarist/vocalist Laura Pleasants adds. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most rewarding for us to try and push our own boundaries of what we can to do with our music and hopefully, in the end, offer something that is at least original.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nKylesaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third full-length, Time Will Fuse Its Worth, is the eagerly-awaited follow-up to 2005ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s To Walk a Middle Course, which topped many year end lists and landed the band in metal and mainstream press alike. After grabbing ink in Spin, the New York Times, and metal mainstays Revolver alike, Time Will Fuse Its Worth again showcases the band as the ultimate definition of do-it-yourself dedication. With Cope lending his ears and hands for production duties at The Jam Room, and featuring comprehensive artistic layout and packaging from Pleasants, the Kylesa of current day continues to put the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future in their own hands by relentlessly touring Europe and North America alike.\n\nTime Will Fuse Its Worth sees the band continuing to evolve upon KylesaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature sound, seamlessly flowing from track to track encompassing listeners with sounds far and wide and an utter disregard for musical boundaries. Bringing together avant-garde experimentalism with the pure fury of dirty, sludgy riffs and raw, coexisting male and female vocals, KylesaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ambient noise interludes, grimy rock riffs and impassioned, gruff vocals portray the doom-inspired punishment they are capable of dishing out through the power of the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music.\n\nFollowing the release of Time Will Fuse Its Worth, the drumming duo of Jeff Porter and Carl McGinley were added to the band. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen we first started the band, we had planned on having two drummers but it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work out, so now it feels like everything is coming together,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Pleasants says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is definitely a new level of intensity to Kylesa now. Since the new lineup has gotten together we have felt the strongest creative spark yet.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nKylesa released their latest album Static Tensions on March 17, 2009. On this album, drummer Eric Hernandez was added to the band.\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s reluctance to attach itself to one sound or scene and to not play by conventional rules, along with that strong creative spark, has ultimately made Kylesa that much more versatile. With a constantly heavy touring schedule has found the band crossing boundaries, sharing bills with bands as diverse as High On Fire, Pinback, Coliseum, Torche, and Mastodon, as well as playing to enthusiastic crowds throughout Europe. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhile we are no kings of one scene,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Cope, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwe have, in a sense, just developed our own thing.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nCurrent line-up\nPhillip Cope - Guitar, Vocals (Damad)\nLaura Pleasants - Guitar, Vocals\nCarl McGinley - Drums, Noises (Unpersons, Bite Itself, ismb...d, Whiskey Dick (USA))\nEric Hernandez - Drums (Capsule)\nCorey Barhorst - Bass (Cobra Kai)\n\nGenre = Sludge metal\nFormat = mp3\nBit Rate = 256 kbps\nFile Size = 70.17 MB\n\nTracklist\n1.
