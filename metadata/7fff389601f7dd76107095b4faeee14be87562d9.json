The Nazi regime, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, has surged to power and now hold Germany by the throat. All non-AryansÃ¢â‚¬â€especially Jews like Jacob and his familyÃ¢â‚¬â€are treated like dogs.\n\nWhen tragedy strikes during one terrible night of violence, Jacob flees and joins rebel forces working to undermine the regime. But after a raid goes horribly wrong, Jacob finds himself in a living nightmareÃ¢â‚¬â€trapped in a crowded, stinking car on the train to the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nAs World War II rages and Hitler begins implementing his Ã¢â‚¬Å“final solutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to systematically and ruthlessly exterminate the Jewish people, Jacob must rely on his wits and a God heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure he believes in to somehow escape from Auschwitz and alert the world to the NaziÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s atrocities before Fascism overtakes all of Europe. The fate of millions hangs in the balance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fff389601f7dd76107095b4faeee14be87562d9","amp;dn":"The+Auschwitz+Escape+-+Joel+C.+Rosenberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fff389601f7dd76107095b4faeee14be87562d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,255,56,150,1,247,221,118,16,112,149,180,250,238,225,75,232,117,98,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
