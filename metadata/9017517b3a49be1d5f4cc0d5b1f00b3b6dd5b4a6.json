The recordings come from the 1980s and are Romantic by the standards of contemporary, period performance standards. Nevertheless, they will satisfy anyone who loves these symphonies--the recordings of 40 and 41 are most likely the best I've heard.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9017517b3a49be1d5f4cc0d5b1f00b3b6dd5b4a6","amp;dn":"Mozart+-+The+Late+Symphonies+-+Bernstein%2C+VPO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9017517b3a49be1d5f4cc0d5b1f00b3b6dd5b4a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,23,81,123,58,73,190,29,95,76,192,213,177,240,11,59,109,213,180,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
