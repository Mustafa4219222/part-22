Marked through hardship and day-to-day experiences he creates his own world, expressed via his very unique songs. He simply follows his nature and performs his music and writes songs. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an original thinker, a philosopher, trying to find his own way and understanding for a world that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always Paradise. He used to be a traveler; he traveled through the world and spell-bounds, in small CafÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and BarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. His religion and the support of his wife Dixie - who protected him from a world in which he did not know how to manage Ã¢â‚¬â€œ give him strength to carry out his wonderful music. His rural songs are like bare bones, direct and open, stripped from all decorations. His style is carved by life itself. From his adolescence in the Deep South to the coffeehouse circuit of early `70s LA, to Nashville and beyond, David Munyon`s life has been a musical odyssey of truly Homeric proportions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:418daa7a35a00f86b073e3bca67a1f77210d860a","amp;dn":"David+Munyon+-+Slim+Possibilities+%5B1996%5D%5BEAC%2FFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"418daa7a35a00f86b073e3bca67a1f77210d860a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,141,170,122,53,160,15,134,176,115,227,188,166,122,31,119,33,13,134,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
