When he realizes he's suicidal, he checks himself into the psychiatric ward of a hospital, thinking they'll do an observation, help him, and send him home in time for school the next day. Once in, however, he must stay for a week; the juvenile ward is being renovated, so he's in with adults as well as a few youths. Bobby, a man with a young daughter, shows him around; Craig notices Noelle, about his age. He tries to keep his friends from finding out where he is. Little things: he draws, goes to therapy, sings, helps Bobby rehearse an interview. Is this the stuff of insight?\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/uAFqA6V.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/uAFqA6V.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/FgUUq6w.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/FgUUq6w.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/nyy8ZAP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/nyy8ZAP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/Mv4Bhpw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/Mv4Bhpw.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: Its.Kind.Of.A.Funny.Story.2010.720p.BluRay.x264-REFiNED\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 2645M\nPlayTime           : 01:41:18.331\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 1280 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 688 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 23.975fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 114972\nVideoBitRate       : 2997505\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : AC3\nAudioBitRate       : 640000\nAudioChannels      : 6\nAudioSampleRate    : 48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f731aa27dae48097e54f7c7dce047e084a619bd","amp;dn":"Its+Kind+Of+A+Funny+Story+2010+BRRip+XvidHD+720p-NPW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f731aa27dae48097e54f7c7dce047e084a619bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,115,26,162,125,174,72,9,126,84,247,199,220,224,71,224,132,166,25,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
