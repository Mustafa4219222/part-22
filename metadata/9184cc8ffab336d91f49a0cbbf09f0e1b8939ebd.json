Songs for the album were written mid-2011, with recording starting from early-2012 and going into March 2013, with mixing being handled in the same month. In between that time period, an unmixed version of &quot;Violence (Enough Is Enough)&quot; was streamed from the band's website in December 2012. The band then embarked on the Right Back at It Again Tour in March 2013, performing the new song &quot;Right Back at It Again&quot; at each show, then performing another song that would appear on the album, &quot;Dead &amp; Buried&quot;, at each stop of the following House Party Tour, beginning in September 2013. A few months before the recording of the album started, in December 2011, the band was involved in a lawsuit with their label Victory, which had parts resolved a few days before the album's release. This lawsuit led to the band's initial digital self-release of the album on October 8, with a physical release set to follow on November 25, featuring three bonus tracks.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FIgkX3F.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/FIgkX3F.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9184cc8ffab336d91f49a0cbbf09f0e1b8939ebd","amp;dn":"A+Day+to+Remember+-+Common+Courtesy+%5B2013%5D+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9184cc8ffab336d91f49a0cbbf09f0e1b8939ebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,132,204,143,250,179,54,217,31,73,160,203,191,9,240,225,184,147,158,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
