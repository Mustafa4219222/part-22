At the bottom of this page, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Ã¢â‚¬Å“File sharingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ section Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just select OPlayer HD in the list, and add files from there. Note that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to sync your iPhone or iPad to iTunes to add movies. Just drop files in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“File sharingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ tab, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be uploaded immediately.

The other iDevices have limited computing power, and cannot handle the complex task of decoding HD movies in real time.\n\n* The audio and the video is not in sync? \nThat is because the CPU is not power enough to do video decoding, you can try to enable &quot;Skip Frame&quot; in the file detail page.\n\n* Is there a TV-out support? \nYep, but TV-out function only supported by iPod gen4, iPhone4, iPhone4S and iPad 1/2.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76ef057bcb851b5d5cfcb8889a14f3687ad83e2b","amp;dn":"OPlayer+HD+v.2.0.07+%5BiPad%5D%5BsweEpub%5D%5Bcracked%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76ef057bcb851b5d5cfcb8889a14f3687ad83e2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,239,5,123,203,133,27,93,92,252,184,136,154,20,243,104,122,216,62,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
