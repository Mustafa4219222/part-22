Send a million messages a day to your friends for free! WhatsApp uses your Internet connection: 3G/EDGE or Wi-Fi when available.\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ MULTIMEDIA: Send Video, Images, and Voice notes to your friends and contacts.\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group conversations with your contacts.\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: Just like there is no added cost to send an international email, there is no cost to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends all over the world as long as they have WhatsApp Messenger installed and avoid those pesky international SMS costs.\n\nÃ¢Ëœâ€¦ SAY NO TO PINS AND USERNAMES: Why even bother having to remember yet another PIN or username? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS would, and integrates flawlessly with your existing phone address book.\n\nRecent changes:\n2.8.4313 website release / 2012-SEP-11\n2.8.4278 website release / 2012-SEP-10\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ miscellaneous bug fixes, translations and improvements\n2.8.4138 website release / 2012-SEP-06\n2.8.4129 website release / 2012-SEP-06\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ miscellaneous bug fixes, translations and improvements\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢ group chat limit raised to 30 participants\nLess description Ã‚Â»\n\nLatest version: v2.8.4313 (for Android version 2.1 and higher)\n\n\n                                By bobiras2009\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4f925b22d96100d5722fb263765b98297e736e6","amp;dn":"WhatsApp+Messenger+v2.8.4313+Final+By+bobiras2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4f925b22d96100d5722fb263765b98297e736e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,249,37,178,45,150,16,13,87,34,251,38,55,101,185,130,151,231,54,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
