Every piece of the web application stack, from HTTP requests to browser-side scripts, comes with important yet subtle security consequences. To keep users safe, it is essential for developers to confidently navigate this landscape.\n\nIn The Tangled Web, Michal Zalewski, one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top browser security experts, offers a compelling narrative that explains exactly how browsers work and why theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re fundamentally insecure. Rather than dispense simplistic advice on vulnerabilities, Zalewski examines the entire browser security model, revealing weak points and providing crucial information for shoring up web application security. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn how to:\n\nPerform common but surprisingly complex tasks such as URL parsing and HTML sanitization\nUse modern security features like Strict Transport Security, Content Security Policy, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\nLeverage many variants of the same-origin policy to safely compartmentalize complex web applications and protect user credentials in case of XSS bugs\nBuild mashups and embed gadgets without getting stung by the tricky frame navigation policy\nEmbed or host user-supplied content without running into the trap of content sniffing\nFor quick reference, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSecurity Engineering Cheat SheetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at the end of each chapter offer ready solutions to problems youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re most likely to encounter. With coverage extending as far as planned HTML5 features, The Tangled Web will help you create secure web applications that stand the test of time.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1 Security in the World of Web Applications\n\nPart I: Anatomy of the Web\nChapter 2 It Starts with a URL\nChapter 3 Hypertext Transfer Protocol\nChapter 4 Hypertext Markup Language\nChapter 5 Cascading Style Sheets\nChapter 6 Browser-Side Scripts\nChapter 7 Non-HTML Document Types\nChapter 8 Content Rendering with Browser Plug-ins\n\nPart II: Browser Security Features\nChapter 9 Content Isolation Logic\nChapter 10 Origin Inheritance\nChapter 11 Life Outside Same-Origin Rules\nChapter 12 Other Security Boundaries\nChapter 13 Content Recognition Mechanisms\nChapter 14 Dealing with Rogue Scripts\nChapter 15 Extrinsic Site Privileges\n\nPart III: A Glimpse of Things to Come\nChapter 16 New and Upcoming Security Features\nChapter 17 Other Browser Mechanisms of Note\n\nChapter 18 Common Web Vulnerabilities\n\nAppendix Epilogue\nNotes\nUPDATES\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 320 pages\nPublisher: No Starch Press (November 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1593273886\nISBN-13: 978-1593273880","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5598e9075bb73e7664c1b139e841232cf9418d93","amp;dn":"No.Starch.The.Tangled.Web.Nov.2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5598e9075bb73e7664c1b139e841232cf9418d93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,152,233,7,91,183,62,118,100,193,177,57,232,65,35,44,249,65,141,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
