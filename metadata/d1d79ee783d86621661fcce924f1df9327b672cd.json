Best Way to Learn Digital Photography, Master Your DSLR Camera &amp; Improve Your Digital SLR Photography Skills | EPUB | PDF\r\n\r\nIf you want to stand out from the crowd and capture all those magic moments for posterity, you have come to the right place. Most guides to Digital SLR photography will overwhelm you with jargon, but you and I both know thatâ€™s not what photography is all about.\r\n\r\nWhen I first started out, I couldnâ€™t find any course or guide that actually helped me become a better photographer. Everything out there was either packed to overflowing with technical terms or far too expensive for my means. All I wanted was to know how to take the photographs I could see in my mind â€“ and nobody was helping me do that.\r\n\r\nThat's why Iâ€™ve written this guide â€“ so you donâ€™t have to go through what I did.\r\n\r\nGive Me Just 48 HOURS and I'll Make You TEN Times a Better Photographer\r\nAnd I will do it for less than the cost of a cup of coffee. Signing up for an expensive course can cost you upwards of $1000. What a waste when all you need to know is in this book.\r\n\r\nOwning a Digital SLR Camera Is All about Taking Beautiful Pictures\r\nIf you have paid out money to invest in a decent camera, Iâ€™m betting that, like me, you havenâ€™t done so just to learn how many buttons it has or what lenses are made out of. In this guide, weâ€™ll be sidestepping the boring technical information and focusing on what really matters: showing you how to use your camera to take the photographs youâ€™ve always dreamed of, using all the benefit of my many years of experience as a photographer and the hard-earned knowledge I have gathered along the way. Some of the things we'll cover are:\r\n\r\nHow to compose an image to put the focus where you want it.\r\nThe tricks and techniques the professionals use to make magic with their lens.\r\nHow to tell stories with your camera by manipulating your angles and framing.\r\nEverything that makes an image pop, from the rule of thirds to context and focal points.\r\nHow to mix things up with specialized alternatives, from wide angle to telephoto and fish eye to tilt and shift.\r\nHow to use polarizing filters, neutral density filters and ultraviolet filters to best effect.\r\nHow to see images like the professionals do and use your equipment to get the shot you want.\r\nDeveloping an Eye for Photography IS Possible - Even If You're a Complete Beginner!\r\n\r\nEven if you have never picked up a camera in your life, this book will help you look at everyday scenes with the practice eyes of a professional. By the time you complete this guide, you will know exactly what makes a photograph work â€“ and exactly how to take it.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1d79ee783d86621661fcce924f1df9327b672cd","amp;dn":"DSLR+Photography+for+Beginners%3A+Take+10+Times+Better+Pictures+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1d79ee783d86621661fcce924f1df9327b672cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,215,158,231,131,216,102,33,102,31,204,233,36,241,223,147,39,182,114,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
