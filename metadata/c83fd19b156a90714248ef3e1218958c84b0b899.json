It was released with 1962?1966 (or the Red Album), a compilation of their greatest hits from 1962 to 1966. The cover art shows the band once again looking down the stairwell of EMI&amp;#039;s Manchester Square headquarters in London; the same pose, camera angle and setting as used for the cover on the Please Please Me and The Beatles 1962?1966 albums, which used different photos from the same photo session. The image was originally shot for the Get Back album, which later became Let It Be, but in the end the photograph was not used for that project.\n\nThe Beatles themselves participated in selecting the songs for inclusion, as well as the colours and pictures. The colour blue was chosen in tribute to one of their favourite football teams (Everton F.C.). Even though the group had had success with cover versions of songs, most notably with &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; which made #2 on the Billboard charts, only songs composed by the Beatles themselves were included. Songs performed by the Beatles as solo artists were also considered for inclusion, but like the cover songs, limited space on LPs resulted in this idea having to be abandoned.\n\nOne\n&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; ? 4:10 \n&quot;Penny Lane&quot; ? 3:03 \n&quot;Sgt.
