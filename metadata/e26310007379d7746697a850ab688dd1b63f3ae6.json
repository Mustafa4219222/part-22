The notion was to capture something raw  |\n|and original. He searched for something unpretentious and genuine,     |\n|yearning to make a film that would stand out from other music          |\n|documentaries and potentially redefine the genre. Who he found         |\n|was the band Electric Apricot, what he achieved is enlightenment.      |\n|Unexpectedly while searching for enlightenment the duality of          |\n|existence was unveiled.                                                |\n|                                                                       |\n|                                                                       |\n|                                                                       |\n|Ripped and Encoded by -=Yeti=-                                         |\n_________________________________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e26310007379d7746697a850ab688dd1b63f3ae6","amp;dn":"National.Lampoon.presents.Electric.Apricot.quest.for.festeroo-%3DY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e26310007379d7746697a850ab688dd1b63f3ae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,99,16,0,115,121,215,116,102,151,168,80,171,104,141,209,182,63,58,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
