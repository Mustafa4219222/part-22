But was the death accidental? A delightful and wholly unexpected murder mystery, British writer/director Sidney Gilliat's Green For Danger features Trevor Howard and Sally Gray as suspected doctors and Alastair Sim in a marvelous turn as Scotland Yard's insouciant Inspector Cockrill. A screenwriter who had worked with Hitchcock on such films as The Lady Vanishes and Jamaica Inn, Gilliat slyly upends whodunit conventions with wit and style.\n\nMenus-Yes\nExtras-Yes\n\nSpecial Features including\nAudio commentary by film and music historian Bruce Eder\nNew interview with British film historian Geoff Brown\n\n\nLet's get this SEEDED people!!
