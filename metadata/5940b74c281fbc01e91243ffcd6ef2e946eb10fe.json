Heeger, University of California at Santa Barbara, Alan G. MacDiarmid at the University of Pennsylvania, and Hideki Shirakawa at the University of Tsukuba. Since then, the unique properties of conducting polymers have led to promising applications in functional materials and technologies. The book first briefly summarizes the main concepts of conducting polymers before introducing micro/nanostructured conducting polymers dealing with their synthesis, structural characterizations, formation mechanisms, physical and chemical properties, and potential applications in nanomaterials and nanotechnology. The book is intended for researchers in the related fields of chemistry, physics, materials, nanomaterials and nanodevices. Meixiang Wan is a professor at the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5940b74c281fbc01e91243ffcd6ef2e946eb10fe","amp;dn":"Conducting+Polymers+with+Micro+or+Nanometer+Structure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5940b74c281fbc01e91243ffcd6ef2e946eb10fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,64,183,76,40,31,188,1,233,18,67,255,205,110,242,233,70,235,16,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
