No further orders will be taken.\n\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not been gone more than a few hours, and already the national media have cranked into gear and begun the blandly respectful eulogies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at their most critical they seem to be only able to say: Ã¢â‚¬ËœShe polarised opinion Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain is how much of an impact she made on Britain Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ etc etcÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nTwitter set off at a pace with a thousand Ã¢â‚¬ËœDing Dong the Witch is DeadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ messages only to be followed by a slew of bleeding heart liberals bemoaning the fact that people were daring to celebrate someoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death.\n\nPah! LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s make it clear: This is a cause to celebrate, to party, to stamp the dirt down. Tomorrow we can carry on shouting and writing and working and singing and striking against the successive governments that have so clearly followed ThatcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Slash &amp; Burn policies, none more so than the present lot. But for now, we can have a drink and a dance and propose a toast to the demise of someone who blighted so many peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives for so long.\n\nIf we must show a little reverence and decorum at this time, then so be it. Our deepest sympathies go out to the families of all Margaret ThatcherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victims.\n\nChumbawamba, 8th April 2013\n\n=======\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/4460591&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/4460591&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=======\n\nTracklisting:\n\n01.
