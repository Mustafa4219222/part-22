The band had its roots in the Irish show band scene of the mid-'60s -- guitarist Henry McCullough had put his time in, playing with outfits such as the Sky Rockets and Gene &amp; the Gents, based on Portstewart, Northern Ireland. By 1967, McCullough had decided to take his talent and career elsewhere and headed to Belfast and then to England, to Blackpool, where he crossed paths with Chris Stewart (bass), Ernie Graham (guitar/vocals), and Dave Lutton (drums). The latter were all ex-members of a show band called Tony &amp; the Telstars, and with McCullough decided to form a psychedelic band that they christened the People. They made their way to London, where they struggled just to earn a decent living -- but a fortuitous gig at the UFO Club brought them to the attention of Mike Jeffery and Chas Chandler, the two managers of Jimi Hendrix. They got the band -- renamed Eire Apparent at Jeffery's insistence -- signed to Track Records, the imprint belonging to Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp (for which Hendrix also recorded), who were also the managers of the Who.For musicians who had been living in dire poverty when they arrived in London, the whirlwind of VIP representation they'd stepped into and the opportunities suddenly presenting themselves were astonishing. And it only got better when Eire Apparent were booked onto Hendrix's next tour of the British isles, working alongside acts such as the Move and such up-and-coming bands as Pink Floyd and the Nice. The finish to 1967 was capped by the recording of their first single, &quot;Follow Me&quot; b/w &quot;Here I Go Again,&quot; which was issued in January of 1968. The record never charted, however, and marked their last release on Track.\n.\nNext it was off to America, supporting Hendrix, Eric Burdon &amp; the Animals, and Soft Machine (both acts managed by Jeffery). They spent a large part of 1968 playing shows in the United States, and had one show scheduled in Canada. At that point, the group's fortunes suffered a setback when McCullough was arrested, in part due to problems with his visa, and deported to\nIreland. It marked his exit from the band, as he was summarily replaced by Mick Cox, who completed the tour with the group and became a permanent member.\nThe following month, the reconfigured Eire Apparent resumed their run at stardom with an album. What made the record special, beyond what the four members brought to the table, was the presence of Jimi Hendrix as producer. Hendrix had previously served in a similar capacity on behalf of Cat Mother &amp; the All Night Newsboys, but Eire Apparent attracted somewhat more attention, owing to the fact that their album received an American release through the Buddah label, which also issued their second single, &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Band&quot; b/w &quot;Yes I Need Someone.&quot;\nNote: Rock 'n' Roll Band was not released on their debut album 'Sunrise' but was later added to the later CD re-release of this album.\n.\nHendrix also played on both sides of the single, as well as on the Chris Stewart-authored album track &quot;The Clown,&quot; but his involvement with their music was more complex than even these moments of direct participation. The guitarist apparently saw Eire Apparent as a vehicle for more pop-oriented sounds than he usually got to explore on his own recordings, freely mixing softer sounds with a strong psychedelic influence amid the harder sound that was the group's forte. The harder sounds of songs such as &quot;Morning Glory&quot; were juxtaposed with more lyrical moments, vocally and instrumentally, without ever losing sight of their basic heavy electric sound. The results -- to which Robert Wyatt (Soft Machine) and Noel Redding also apparently contributed -- were off-putting to some who expected something different from a project related to Jimi Hendrix, and also may have arrived a little late for the psychedelic influences.\nThe album, entitled Sunrise, was issued on the Buddah label in the United States, and thanks to Hendrix's name on it and the time they put in touring, it did sell better than some Buddah releases of the era that didn't have a hit single to drive sales or get AM radio play. Copies of the record turned up in collections and used bins from time to time from the 1970s through the 1990s (and, indeed, still sometimes show up), which is more than can be said for some Buddah LPs of the era. But sales were nowhere near what was needed to break the group properly in the U.S. (and thanks to the U.S.-only release, Sunrise became a true rarity in England). Additionally, Eire Apparent had run into serious trouble on two fronts. Their extended time touring America\n.\nhad left them without an audience in England, and the gigs there dried up when the bandmembers were left to their own devices (and not touring with Hendrix). Additionally, they parted company with Jeffery after a tour of Europe opening for Hendrix. Without him, Burdon, or Soft Machine to headline, however, and without a hit record, their prospects in America were now dimmed considerably. Most of '69 was spent slogging round the English clubs and universities, trying to re-establish themselves in a country that had largely forgotten them. It was to prove to be an uphill task. At least one personnel change took place, Mike Cox left (eventually forming his own band) and was replaced by Tiger Taylor who took over guitar. It's also rumoured that Pete Tolson (aka Pretty Things) also passed through the band. In May '69, Beat Instrumental reported that they were recording tracks for a new album, but nothing has ever surfaced. The only 'recordings' known from this era are the three tracks done for a Top Gear session (20/4/69), 'Yes I Need Someone', 'Highway 61' and the popular 'Gloria'. (If anyone passing, has seen these tracks, please leave a comment as I have yet to find them and would dearly love to hear them).\n\nThe band survived until the end of the year and finally gave up. In later years, Eire Apparent were mostly remembered as a footnote to Hendrix's career, though the members remained active throughout the ensuing decade and beyond. Eire Apparent were not the greatest band of the 60's, but they certainly were an excellent one and will always be remembered for their contributions to the glorious era of psychedelic music and their association with the legendary 'Jimi Hendrix'\n.\nErnie Graham went on to cut an excellent solo album for UA, joined Help Yourself and during the pub-rock days fronted Clancy. The others kept a lower profile, Mick Cox organized a band of his own and worked with Van Morrison, among others, while Dave Lutton passed through the lineup of Heavy Jelly, before crossing paths professionally with Marc Bolan and Chris Spedding. Chris Stewart went on to become a top session man, while Henry McCullough, following his sudden exit from the band, jumped to Spooky Tooth and then the Grease Band. He backed Joe Cocker on the With a Little Help From My Friends album, and did a lot of session work (including Donovan's Essence to Essence). He was also a member of Paul McCartney's Wings in one of its early configurations, on the Red Rose Speedway album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee2eae4ca072b5534602a3ffc29ad8b2fa75556","amp;dn":"Eire+Apparent+-+Sunrise+%281969%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee2eae4ca072b5534602a3ffc29ad8b2fa75556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,226,234,228,202,7,43,85,52,96,42,63,252,41,173,139,47,167,85,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
