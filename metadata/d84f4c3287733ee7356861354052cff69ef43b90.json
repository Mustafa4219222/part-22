A hundred years ago, a meteor hit that area and now bad things are happening there. Or maybe bad things were always happening there, but this reality show (cast and crew) are now there to document it. It begins with one contestant getting badly injured and things get worse after no help arrives and more strange occurrences begin to take place. They eventually start to realize it's not part of the show.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d84f4c3287733ee7356861354052cff69ef43b90","amp;dn":"Siberia.S01E01.Xvid-AJAXEN.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d84f4c3287733ee7356861354052cff69ef43b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,79,76,50,135,115,62,231,53,104,97,53,64,82,207,246,158,244,59,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
