Chewie and Han Solo are trying to get to the planet where Chewie\\'s family is waiting for him, but the empire is out searching for the rebels, giving everyone a hard time. While we are waiting we get a look at the everyday life of a Wookiee family. We meet all the familiar characters from Star Wars and we are introduced to Boba Fett during a small cartoon. We also pay a visit to the Cantina and meet all the monsters again.\n\n\nCast\nCast overview, first billed only:\nMark Hamill \tMark Hamill \t... \tLuke Skywalker\nHarrison Ford \tHarrison Ford \t... \tHan Solo\nCarrie Fisher \tCarrie Fisher \t... \tPrincess Leia Organa\nAnthony Daniels \tAnthony Daniels \t... \tC-3PO\nPeter Mayhew \tPeter Mayhew \t... \tChewbacca\nJames Earl Jones \tJames Earl Jones \t... \tDarth Vader (voice)\nBea Arthur \tBea Arthur \t... \tAckmena\nArt Carney \tArt Carney \t... \tSaundan\nDiahann Carroll \tDiahann Carroll \t... \tMermeia Holographic Wow\nMarty Balin \tMarty Balin \t... \tHolographic Band Singer (as The Jefferson Starship)\nCraig Chaquico \tCraig Chaquico \t... \tHolographic Band Member (as The Jefferson Starship)\nDavid Freiberg \tDavid Freiberg \t... \tHolographic Band Singer (as The Jefferson Starship)\nPaul Kantner \tPaul Kantner \t... \tHolographic Band Member (as The Jefferson Starship)\nHarvey Korman \tHarvey Korman \t... \tKrelman / Chef Gormaanda / Amorphian instructor\nMickey Morton \tMickey Morton \t... \tMalla \n\n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193524/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193524/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCountry: USA\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 17 November 1978 (Canada) See more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nAlso Known As: The \\'Star Wars\\' Christmas Special See more Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»\nFilming Locations: Burbank, California, USA\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nRuntime: 97 min  | 120 min (including commercials)\nSound Mix: Mono\nColor: Color \n\n\n3.63 GB ISO (3,903,356,928 bytes) \n\nBurn using poweriso or nero ...etc.\n\nprint and enjoy from Slickinator\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f8805fcdcef95c3d55d9a3cfa97dc2868fe4a53","amp;dn":"STARWARS+HOLIDAY+SPECIAL+%2B+Covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f8805fcdcef95c3d55d9a3cfa97dc2868fe4a53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,136,5,252,220,239,149,195,213,93,154,60,250,151,220,40,104,254,74,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
