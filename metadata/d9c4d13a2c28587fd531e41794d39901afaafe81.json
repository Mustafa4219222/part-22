He later became an Internet folk hero, pushing to make many Web files free and open to the public. But in July 2011, he was indicted on federal charges of gaining illegal access to JSTOR, a subscription-only service for distributing scientific and literary journals, and downloading 4.8 million articles and documents, nearly the entire library.\r\n\r\nCharges in the case, including wire fraud and computer fraud, were pending at the time of Mr. Swartzâ€™s death, carrying potential penalties of up to 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.\r\n\r\nâ€œAaron built surprising new things that changed the flow of information around the world,â€ said Susan Crawford, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law in New York who served in the Obama administration as a technology adviser. She called Mr. Swartz â€œa complicated prodigyâ€ and said â€œgraybeards approached him with awe.â€\r\n\r\nMr. Wolf said he would remember his nephew, who had written in the past about battling depression and suicidal thoughts, as a young man who â€œlooked at the world, and had a certain logic in his brain, and the world didnâ€™t necessarily fit in with that logic, and that was sometimes difficult.â€\r\n\r\nThe Tech, a newspaper of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, reported Mr. Swartzâ€™s death early Saturday.&quot;\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/technology/aaron-swartz-internet-activist-dies-at-26.html\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c4d13a2c28587fd531e41794d39901afaafe81","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Aug+20+Internet+Kid+Swarz+Dead.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c4d13a2c28587fd531e41794d39901afaafe81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,196,209,58,44,40,88,127,213,49,228,23,148,211,153,1,175,170,254,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
