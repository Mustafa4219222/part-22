Dennis buys Ben &amp; JerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ice cream even though he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand their\n politics, because he values liberty over equality.\n Dennis warns that this all leads to a society where people buy things based on the politics of the owner rather\n than qualityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and Dennis hopes that day never comes.\n\n\nPrager 20120730     1 The Moment of Silence\n\nPrager H1    Dennis reflects on the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Olympic games in London, RomneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comments,\n the Greek tweet, the developing situation in Syria, WomanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Volleyball uniforms, and the moment of silence in \n remembrance of the athletes killed in Munich 1972.
