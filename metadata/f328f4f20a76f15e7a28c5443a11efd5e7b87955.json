This is Casey Kasem and we're about to count down the forty most popular songs in America this week.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This is a recording of a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nCasey gives the details of the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;Of all the solo singers who have hit the top 40, which one has the longest name?&quot; Well, it was Arnold Dorsey before he changed it.\n\nAnother listener writes in wanting to know, &quot;What was the first country song to hit number one on the pop chart?&quot; It was an anti-smoking song.\n\nThere was a band that desperately needed a keyboard player just six days away from the start of their first big American tour. When the bass player suggested letting his wife have the job, she ended up singing and writing half of their first album and two of their first four top 40 hits. That band is in this countdown.\n\nThe first all-white group to hit number one on the soul chart has a hit in the top ten.\n\n40:    Fernando - Abba\n39:    Don't Stop Believin' - Olivia Newton-John\n38:    The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald - Gordon Lightfoot            \n37:    You Are The Woman - Firefall\n36:    Sunrise - Eric Carmen\n35:    Superstar - Paul Davis\n34:    Get The Funk Out Ma Face - The Brothers Johnson\n33:    Baby I Love Your Way - Peter Frampton\n32:    It's O.K. - The Beach Boys\n31:    This Masquerade - George Benson\n30:    Beth - Kiss\n29:    Let 'Em In - Wings\n28:    Heaven Must Be Missing An Angel (Part 1) - Tavares\n27:    (Don't Fear) The Reaper - Blue Oyster Cult        \n26:    One Love In My Lifetime - Diana Ross\n25:    Don't Go Breaking My Heart - Elton John &amp; Kiki Dee\n24:    Magic Man - Heart\n23:    I Only Want To Be With You - Bay City Rollers\n22:    Shower The People - James Taylor\n21:    Rock'n Me - The Steve Miller Band\n20:    You Should Be Dancing - The Bee Gees\n19:    That'll Be The Day - Linda Ronstadt\n18:    Who'd She Coo - The Ohio Players\n17:    Wham Bam - Silver\n16:    She's Gone - Hall &amp; Oates\n15:    Getaway - Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\n14:    A Little Bit More - Dr. Hook\n13:    Still The One - Orleans\n12:    With Your Love - Jefferson Starship\n11:    Say You Love Me - Fleetwood Mac\n10:    You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine - Lou Rawls\n9:    Disco Duck (Part 1) - Rick Dees\n8:    If You Leave Me Now - Chicago\n7:    Summer - War\n6:    Devil Woman - Cliff Richard\n5:    Lowdown - Boz Scaggs\n4:    (Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty - K.C. &amp; The Sunshine Band\n3:    A Fifth Of Beethoven - Walter Murphy &amp; The Big Apple Band\n2:    I'd Really Love To See You Tonight - England Dan &amp; John Ford Coley\n1:    Play That Funky Music - Wild Cherry\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f328f4f20a76f15e7a28c5443a11efd5e7b87955","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1976_September_25th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f328f4f20a76f15e7a28c5443a11efd5e7b87955","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,40,244,242,10,118,241,94,122,40,197,68,58,17,239,213,231,184,121,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
