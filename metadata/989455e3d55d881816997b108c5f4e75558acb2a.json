In the remote Nevada desert there sits a dry lakebed called Groom Lake, and under that land resides a secret base that holds all the secrets of the world. Not this world, either. Writer Chris Ryall and artist Ben Templesmith present a four-part tale of abductions and probings, conspiracies and secrets. And the key to it all is held in the grey, six-fingered hand of one Ng Hudson. Templesmith provides two covers for the debut issue!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:989455e3d55d881816997b108c5f4e75558acb2a","amp;dn":"Groom+Lake+%2801+-+04%29+%282009%29+%28Digital%29+%28K6-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"989455e3d55d881816997b108c5f4e75558acb2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,148,85,227,213,93,136,24,22,153,123,16,140,95,78,117,85,138,203,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
