The video which had been sent to the police and the media identifies the killer as the East Coast Killer. McPherson sees Hernandez reporting on the killing on TV and later arranges a meeting. Hernandez is abducted and she wakes up on October 3 in the killer's dilapidated house.\nThe East Coast Killer allowed Hernandez to call McPherson with clues to the location of the house to trap and kill her, a plan he formed with an ex-marine and former FBI agent Hawker who had been dismissed when McPherson refused to back his claim that killing an innocent person had been justified at the time. Despite being successfully ambushed, McPherson managed to turn the tables and saved herself and Hernandez, but not before nearly a dozen police officers and a rookie FBI agent were killed. Through a series of flashbacks, it was revealed that the Chicago Killer was Richard Valdes who turned out to be the grandson of the man Gus was following through Prague.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nStill Life 2 PC jÃƒÂ¡tÃƒÂ©k + magyarÃƒÂ­tÃƒÂ¡s\n\nBorzalmas gyilkossÃƒÂ¡g helyszÃƒÂ­ne a Highway 201, Ellen Dunnigan a szerencsÃƒÂ©tlen ÃƒÂ¡ldozat.
