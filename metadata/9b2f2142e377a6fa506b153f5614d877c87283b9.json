You are Hiro Miyamoto, one of the few people on Earth who remembers what really happened. The burden of saving the world, your version of it, has fallen unto your shoulders. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not alone as your friends, Superfly Johnson and Mikiko Ebihara, travel by your side. You must gather weapons, overcome all obstacles, discover deviously concealed secrets, and battle a bewildering array of foes. Use your resources wisely as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need all the help you can get. Are You Ready?!\n\nFrom the rock star designer, John Romero, comes the legendary, in more ways than one, Daikatana (Ã¢â‚¬Å“long swordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in Japanese). Run Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gun is the norm here as you blast your enemies to oblivion with over 24 glorious, bad ass weapons. On top of the sweet, sweet guns, you are armed with the Daikatana--a weapon that grows in power the more you use it. Go on a wild time-tripping ride and make your enemies Ã¢â‚¬Å“Suck It Down!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.\n\nWAITING ON THE REQUEST LIST TO BE UPLOADED:\n\nFAR CRY\nFAR CRY 2: FORTUNE'S EDITION\nMEDAL OF HONOR: ALLIED ASSAULT WAR CHEST\t\nHEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC 5 BUNDLE\nChildren of the Nile Complete\nStill Life 1\nGhost Master\nGemini Rue\nTo The Moon\nDarwinia\nAlan Wake American Nightmare\nTwo Worlds 2\nThief Gold\nPsychonauts\nFahrenheit\n\n--------------\nREQUESTS THAT I CAN'T FULFILL AT THE MOMENT\n\nLeisure Suit Larry Language Pack\nDon't Starve\nKing of Dragon Pass\nGalactic Civilizations I Ultimate Edition\nThe Cat Lady\nJourneyman Project 3\nDYAD\nSword of the Stars: The Pit\nEtherlords 2\nBioforge\nAvernum: The Complete Saga\nRetro City Rampage\nGreat Battles Collector's Edition\n\n\n\n--------------\n\nIF POSSIBLE, DON'T FORGET TO SUPPORT THE COMPANIES AND GOG.COM FOR THEIR GREAT SERVICE.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b2f2142e377a6fa506b153f5614d877c87283b9","amp;dn":"Daikatana+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b2f2142e377a6fa506b153f5614d877c87283b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,47,33,66,227,119,166,250,80,107,21,63,86,20,216,119,200,114,131,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
