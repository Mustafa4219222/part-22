The battle for survival has just begunÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Lovecraft family is in ruins. Their convict father, Jonah, roams The Barrens, near starvation, in search of his daughter Ana. Only the hope of seeing her again keeps him alive.\n\nMeanwhile Ana, Liam, and Duncan have found temporary relief at a camp outside The Walls. Inside City 6, JonahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s young son, Adam, has been co-opted by JonahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemy, Chief Keller, and is being groomed as a City Watch spy.\n\nBetween the terrifying zombies roaming The BarrensÃ¢â‚¬â€monsters created by the plague that destroyed the Old NationÃ¢â‚¬â€and the ruthless, manipulative government that controls everything and everyone within the City Walls, no one is safe. Z 2135 is both a frightening vision of a dystopian future and a heartening tale of family, hope, and humanity. The newest season from Sean Platt and David Wright is as captivating as it is terrifying.\n\nThis book is part of a trilogy which will conclude in Spring 2014.\nGenre: Science Fiction, Horror\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c70bf66c36442a051ccd5d0308a4885788ea2d1","amp;dn":"Z+2135+-+Wright%2C+David+W_.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c70bf66c36442a051ccd5d0308a4885788ea2d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,112,191,102,195,100,66,160,81,204,213,208,48,138,72,133,120,142,162,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
