It is the band's best-selling album, reaching No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard 200[6] and remaining on that chart for 33 weeks.[7] Three singles also charted: &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; at No. 22 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, &quot;Burning Like a Flame&quot; at No. 20 on Mainstream Rock and No. 72 on the Hot 100, and &quot;Prisoner&quot; at No. 37 on Mainstream Rock.\n\n&quot;Dream Warriors&quot; was first released earlier in 1987 as the theme song for the horror film A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors. The album's title was taken from an earlier Dokken track of the same name recorded during the sessions for Under Lock and Key (1985); it was later released as the B-side to &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;. The 2009 remaster includes &quot;Back for the Attack&quot; as a bonus track.[8]\n\nThe album was the last Dokken studio release before their breakup in 1989, after which they reformed in 1993 and released Dysfunctional in 1995. Dokken toured Japan in April 1988, the material for which was released on the 1988 live album Beast from the East. They also supported Van Halen during their Monsters of Rock Tour 1988 from May 23 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ July 30, 1988.
