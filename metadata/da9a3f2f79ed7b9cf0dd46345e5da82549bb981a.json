Metal Mind Productions will release first ever Gorgoroth DVD entitled Black Mass Krakow 2004 with their spectacular show. Gorgoroth, the Norwegian black metal band, drew the attention of the international media in early 2004 after their show in Krakow. They were accused of &quot;offending religious feelings&quot; during the gig, as well as suspected of breaching Polish law concerning the protection of animal rights by using severed and impaled heads of sheep as part of their stage design. Gorgoroth, widely known for their antichristian ideology, had promised on their web site that the Polish concert would be an &quot;amazing show with lots of pyro, gallons of blood,live crucifixion and nude models.&quot; Despite the fact, the employees of the Krakow branch of TVP claimed that they had no knowledge of what the musicians and the promoters had in mind until they saw the actual performance.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1  - Intro.mp3\n2  - Procreating Satan.mp3\n3  - Forces Of Satan Storms.mp3\n4  - Possessed (By Satan).mp3\n5  - Bergtrollets Hevn.mp3\n6  - The Rite Of Infernal Invocation.mp3\n7  - Profetens Apenbaring.mp3\n8  - Of Ice And Movement...mp3\n9  - Deleggelse Og Undergang.mp3\n10 - Blood Stains The Circle.mp3\n11 - Unchain My Heart!!!.mp3\n12 - Revelation Of Doom.mp3\n13 - Destroyer.mp3\n14 - Incipit Satan.mp3\n\nBitrate....320kbps\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can also find the full concert here:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4242431/\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da9a3f2f79ed7b9cf0dd46345e5da82549bb981a","amp;dn":"Gorgoroth+-+Black+Mass+Krakow++%5BAudio+Rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da9a3f2f79ed7b9cf0dd46345e5da82549bb981a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,154,63,47,121,237,123,156,240,221,70,52,94,93,168,37,73,187,152,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
