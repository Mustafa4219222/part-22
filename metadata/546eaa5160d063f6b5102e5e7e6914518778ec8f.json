I think he stole my heart after the very first encounter with him. Glimpses of the sweet caring boy to the man that he becomes, makes him one hard man to resist.\n\nThere comes a moment in everyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life when they must decide which road leads to personal happiness. For Dylan Silver, this is that momentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nFor the past twenty-two-years, Dylan has been living in her parents' carefully crafted world, always putting her own dreams on hold to play the role of a dutiful daughter.\n\nSo when her best friend coaxes her into a winter getaway to a mountain cabin, she sees it as a chance to forget about the responsibilities waiting for her at home. At least for a little while.\n\nBut then her past catches up to herÃ¢â‚¬â€in the form of sexy snowboarder, Sawyer Carter.\n\nSix years ago, Dylan bid goodbye to the only boy she ever truly loved. Now he's standing right in front of her, bringing up bittersweet memories and igniting suppressed desires as he dares her to be the person she has always wanted to be.\n\nDylan and SawyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unexpected meeting is a second chance, but will a girl who doesn't believe in fate and taking risks be able to overcome her fears of losing control and finally embrace the life she desperately wants?\n\nOnly one thing is certain: after a week in Whistler, Dylan's world will never be the same.\n\n*Please note that this novel contains mature subject matter, including strong language and sexual situations that may not be suitable for all readers.
