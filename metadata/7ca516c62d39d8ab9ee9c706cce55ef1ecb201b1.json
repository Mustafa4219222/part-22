Thrown to the streets with alarming precision by real estate shark Mike Carver, Dennis, out of work and luck, is given a unique opportunity - to join Carver's crew and put others through the harrowing ordeal done to him in order to earn back what's his. \r\n\r\nDelicately training his eye on the rigorous details, the reliably astute Ramin Bahrani imbues his characters with icy complexity to achieve his compassionate portrait of a man whose integrity has become ensnared within an all-too-relevant American crisis. With precision and care, Bahrani's provocative character study applies all the cinematic tools at his disposal to explore the ethical dilemma at the heart of man's struggle to reach higher - by whatever means necessary.\r\n \nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/99_homes/\r\n\r\nTrailer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca516c62d39d8ab9ee9c706cce55ef1ecb201b1","amp;dn":"99.Homes.2014.1920X796p.x264.aac.mp4-makalakato","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca516c62d39d8ab9ee9c706cce55ef1ecb201b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,165,22,198,45,57,216,171,158,233,199,6,204,229,94,241,236,178,1,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
