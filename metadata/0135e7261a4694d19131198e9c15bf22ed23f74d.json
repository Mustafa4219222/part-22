In this course, senior author James Williamson presents an overview of HTML5, demystifies the language's new tags and attributes, and discusses how browsers parse and display HTML5 content. He'll help you make sure your pages (including elements like navigation) are properly structured and sectioned, and show how to use HTML5's unique features for representing quotes, figures, and dates and times. You'll also discover how to extend meaning and make content more accessible with comments, meta- and microdata, and ARIA rolesâ€”elements which lead to better experiences for website visitors and development colleagues alike.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\nWhat are web semantics?\r\nUnderstanding HTML5 content models\r\nSupporting older browsers\r\nStructuring and defining HTML5 documents\r\nUsing headings\r\nBuilding navigation\r\nNesting and grouping content\r\nWorking with HTML5 lists\r\nDefining link relationships\r\nWriting comments\r\nWorking with meta tags\r\nUsing microdata","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0135e7261a4694d19131198e9c15bf22ed23f74d","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+HTML5+Structure%2C+Syntax%2C+and+Semantics+Updated+14.9.2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0135e7261a4694d19131198e9c15bf22ed23f74d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,53,231,38,26,70,148,209,145,49,25,142,156,21,191,34,237,35,247,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
