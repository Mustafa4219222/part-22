Has the standards, and a few extras, Harpo Marx playing take me out to the ballgame on his harp, Bob Hope doing a baseball number with Ricky and Lucy. and many others.\n\nplease remember most of these were ripped from the show, so there are some laughs in the backround. its still a collection worth having for any I Love Lucy fan. Most of the files are .wma format.\n\nCaring is Sharing.
