To do that realisation justice, she seeks out special music-making constellations and fascinating combinations. On When You Make me Smile , she now takes this to the next level: In addition to her working band , with the trusted companions Jonas Ãƒâ€“stholm on the piano, Martin HÃƒÂ¶per on bass and Jonas Holgersson on the drums, she not only gathers an illustrious team of guests around her, like the woodwind and flute player Magnus Lindgren, trombonist Karin Hammar and guitarist Max Schultz, but also an almost 30-strong orchestra. Together with the Dalasinfoniettan, one of the leading orchestras in Sweden, with a wealth of experience in many different styles, the music shines in symphonic splendour and is lent a colourful expressiveness. This represents the fulfilment of a heartfelt dream that Gustafsson has had for a long time.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½This album is a dream come true. I started to write songs about two years ago and contacted Dalasinfoniettan, an absolutely fantastic Swedish orchestra that I love. For a short while I was thinking that there are already so much lovely music out there to record, but felt very fast that for me itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural to compose new material. It has been both a freedom and a challenge to have an orchestra available.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Rigmor Gustafsson)\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Call Me Lonely\n02 - Forget About the Moonlight\n03 - A Different Kind\n04 - If Dreams Are Made of Sand\n05 - When You Make Me Smile\n06 - I Get Along\n07 - Nobody Does It Better\n08 - Stay, Stay, Valentines Day\n09 - Finally Falling in Love\n10 - Blind As a Bat\n11 - Woke up on Sunday\n12 - Let It Go\n13 - Hymn\n\n*2014 ACT Music | 9728-2\n\n\nPersonnel:\nRigmor Gustafsson - vocals\nJonas Ãƒâ€“stholm - piano\nMartin HÃƒÂ¶per - bass\nJonas Holgersson - drums\nMagnus Lindgren - tenor sax, clarinet, flute (on 03, 05 &amp; 11)\nPatrick Skogh - trumpet &amp; flugelhorn (on 03, 05, 09 &amp; 10)\nKarin Hammar - trombone (on 03, 05, 09 &amp; 10)\nAnders Wiborg - bass trombone (on 05, 09 &amp; 10)\nJesper NordenstrÃƒÂ¶m - organ\nCalle Rasmusson - percussion\nDalasinfoniettan conducted by Jonas NydesjÃƒÂ¶\n\nSpecial Guest: Eagle-Eye Cherry / vocals (on 12)\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:062a49d37f4370354ff47c12499eee699ae458be","amp;dn":"Rigmor+Gustafsson+-+When+You+Make+Me+Smile+%282014%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"062a49d37f4370354ff47c12499eee699ae458be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,42,73,211,127,67,112,53,79,244,124,18,73,158,238,105,154,228,88,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
