Share freely!!!\n \ncomments:\nThis concert is the last of a 5 week, mostly club and small venue tour \nbefore they started playing some slightly larger places. it was featuring\nmusic from &quot;the bends&quot; (their 2nd album release), but their biggest hit\nwas probably &quot;creep&quot;, not to be confused with Stone Temple Pilots song\nof same name that came out soon after Radiohead's (completely different song).\nnot long after this, seeing Radiohead in a club gig became impossible, as they \nbecame a major concert attraction in many parts of the world. Fake plastic trees\nbecame a pretty big hit too. \n\nthis is the whole rebroadcast of the concert.\nthe tape was flipped after lucky ended, before creep started so none of the\nmusic is cut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:618c7a94480590fd37a754681e2c949f26e4e825","amp;dn":"Radiohead+-+1996-04-13+-+Avalon+in+Boston%2C+MA++FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"618c7a94480590fd37a754681e2c949f26e4e825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,140,122,148,72,5,144,253,55,167,84,104,30,44,148,159,38,228,232,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
