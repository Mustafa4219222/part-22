He is best known for the 1993 US number-one hit single &quot;Informer&quot;.\n\n12 Inches of Snow is the debut album by Canadian reggae musician Snow, released in 1993. MC Shan produced the entire album, apart from one track which was produced by John Ficarrotta. The album was produced shortly before Snow was imprisoned for a year on an assault charge. Upon his release from prison, his first single &quot;Informer,&quot; featuring MC Shan, became a chart topping hit. It later went on to become one of the largest-selling reggae records of all time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b56da2f56ec31c87200eefb488346b35625b85","amp;dn":"Snow+12+Inches+of+Snow+%5Bmp3%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5BLoC.+Blazer%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b56da2f56ec31c87200eefb488346b35625b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,181,109,162,245,110,195,28,135,32,14,239,180,136,52,107,53,98,91,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
