Juul's chilly, atmospheric electro-folk fits right in with the current 4AD roster (Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, Bon Iver, Grimes, Iron &amp; Wine), but it has a lot more in common with like-minded, eclectic, Copenhagen-bound contemporaries like Choir of Young Believers, Oh No Ono, and Efterklang, all of whom share Indians' penchant for crafting alternately quirky and morose indie pop that's been filtered through the wide angle lens of new wave. \n\n  For the most part, Juul sticks with the Bon Iver/Fleet Foxes model of expansive, confessional indie folk, albeit peppered with electronic flourishes, with highlights arriving via the propulsive &quot;Cakelakers&quot; and the Arcade Fire-esque &quot;I Am Haunted,&quot; but he occasionally veers off into shimmery, Sigur RÃƒÂ³s territory, especially on the lovely second cut &quot;Bird.&quot; Elsewhere, songs like &quot;Magic Kids&quot; and &quot;Reality Sublime&quot; sound like house cuts with all of the beats removed (it's actually pretty effective), and the quietly cascading title track provides a nice bookend to its similarly structured opening volley, resulting in a solid, if a little subtle, debut that promises great things while delivering many very good ones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c7e6c0a4881c3855cc27dc8fadc79f91abcb80","amp;dn":"Indians+-+Somewhere+Else+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c7e6c0a4881c3855cc27dc8fadc79f91abcb80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,199,230,192,164,136,28,56,85,204,39,220,143,173,199,159,145,171,203,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
