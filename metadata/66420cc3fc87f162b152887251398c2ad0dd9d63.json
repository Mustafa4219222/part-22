Hadley (AgentParsec). It shares the same gameplay elements as the original - you must collect 8 pages while avoiding the enemy. This is not intended to be a copy - simply a way for people who loved Slender to be able to face their fear on a different map with the same awesome gameplay. There are some differences which will make playing a somewhat unique experience - different AI, new sounds, and a different environment.\n\nv1.1 of Mansion has been released. New graphical update, easier to pick up objects, and difficulty tweaking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66420cc3fc87f162b152887251398c2ad0dd9d63","amp;dn":"Slender+-+Mansion+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66420cc3fc87f162b152887251398c2ad0dd9d63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,66,12,195,252,135,241,98,177,82,136,114,81,57,140,42,208,221,157,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
