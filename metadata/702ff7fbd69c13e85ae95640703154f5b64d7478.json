My burner \n\npermits some volume balancing between tracks but there are other challenges\n\nas well.\n\n\nThis morning I was able to confirm that on track #8: MELLOW; Jean Luc Ponty is in \n\nfact amplifying his violin through a Leslie organ speaker.  \n\n\nIt is well known that Rusty Young of the novel country rock band POCO put his\n\npedal steel guitar through a Leslie.  The sounds he made were more like an organ \n\nthan a pedal steel.  It sounds as is he's also using some type of WAH device,\n\npossibly the &quot;Thomas&quot; crybaby pedal.\n\n\nMondo thanks to whoever recommended SUEDE: Dog Man Star in the VOL #1 comments.\n\nI haven't been this enthused about an album I'd never heard since discovering\n\nXTC: Skylarking.   Both albums are very complex productions. Check them out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:702ff7fbd69c13e85ae95640703154f5b64d7478","amp;dn":"THE+LESLIE%3A+%28VOLUME+%232++Eclectic%29+Winwood%2CRYoung%2CJLPonty%2CMandel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"702ff7fbd69c13e85ae95640703154f5b64d7478","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,47,247,251,214,156,19,232,90,233,86,64,112,49,84,245,182,77,116,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
