Animal Collective consists of Avey Tare (David Portner), Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Deakin (Josh Dibb), and Geologist (Brian Weitz). Records released under the name Animal Collective may include contributions from any or all of these members; the lineup is not uniform. The band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age. Although the band is often classified as psych folk or noise rock, it is hard to define the Animal Collective sound as they often experiment with diverse styles and ideas from album to album. The group also runs the record label Paw Tracks on which they have released their own material as well as material by artists such as Ariel Pink, Terrestrial Tones, and The Peppermints.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2bf7c8a23b36b001c23c72f8e84319dda49d40","amp;dn":"Animal+Collective-Merriweather+Post+Pavillon-2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2bf7c8a23b36b001c23c72f8e84319dda49d40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,43,247,200,162,59,54,176,1,194,60,114,248,232,67,25,221,164,157,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
