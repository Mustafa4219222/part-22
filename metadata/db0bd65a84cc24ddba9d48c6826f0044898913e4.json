They were organized in a way that they could operate relatively independent from other units. \n\nAs opposed to most other armies in the era, that had usually organized their tanks in &quot;tank brigades&quot; which always needed infantry and artillery support, the panzer divisions had their support units organic in themselves, which led to an automatic change in military doctrine: rather than seeing tanks as a unit to support operations by other units, the tanks became the main focus of attention, with other units supporting them.\n\n\n\n\nFile size : 700 mB\nFormat : Audio Video Interleave\nPlayTime : 47mn 54s\nWriting application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo \nCodec : XviD\nFamily : MPEG-4\nInfo : XviD project\nCodec settings : BVOP\nWidth : 720\nHeight : 416\nAspect ratio : 16/9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio \nCodec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nFamily : MPEG-1\nBit rate : 83 Kbps\nBit rate mode : VBR\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \nChannel(s) : 1 channel\nSampling rate : 48 KHz\nResolution : 16\n\nThis has what i believe to be swedish subs imbedded in it. just thought id let ya know.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db0bd65a84cc24ddba9d48c6826f0044898913e4","amp;dn":"Weapons+Of+War-SS+panzer+Division","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db0bd65a84cc24ddba9d48c6826f0044898913e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,11,214,90,132,204,36,221,186,157,72,198,130,111,0,68,137,137,19,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
