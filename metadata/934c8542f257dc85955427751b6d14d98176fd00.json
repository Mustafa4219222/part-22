The series is written by Brian Michael Bendis and painted by Gabriele Dell&amp;#039;Otto.\n\nThe storyline involves a large scale super-hero crossover featuring Marvel characters such as Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Daredevil, Luke Cage and Nick Fury fighting a wide array of super-villains who have received hi-tech armaments from a mysterious benefactor.\n\nThe aftermath of the series was explored in stories in The Pulse and Bendis has gone on to use many of the same characters in his New Avengers titles.\n\nThe storyline in Secret War is totally unrelated to the original Secret Wars and Secret Wars II crossover limited series which Marvel published in the mid-1980s, although its title is clearly inspired by them. \n\nBendis has noted that Secret War is connected to Secret Invasion where Skrulls have infiltrated several institutions of Earth.\n\nIt is also known as Nick Fury&amp;#039;s Secret War. Enjoy and Seed. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:934c8542f257dc85955427751b6d14d98176fd00","amp;dn":"Secret+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"934c8542f257dc85955427751b6d14d98176fd00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,76,133,66,242,87,220,133,149,84,39,117,27,109,20,217,129,118,253,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
