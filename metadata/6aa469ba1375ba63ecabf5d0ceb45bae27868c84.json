Despite the ghastly sleeve art (not the cover pictured above), i turned it over and noticed &quot;Sympathy&quot; included in the track listings, a song i had heard many times on the radio in the office but had never really taken much notice of, despite it being a huge hit single. The photo of the band clinched it - in those days any strange album i found depicting &quot;four hippies in a field / park / wood&quot; was worth investigating as part of my &quot;scene&quot;. Charisma was a label i'd not seen before, this could have been one of their first releases. After all these years this amazing album is like an old friend i dig out to play regularly, a Rare Bird indeed! I recently bought this album again on a Rare Bird four-album double CD, an Italian label VH-VHRCD001018H/B.\n Though some may think a few tracks on Rare Bird's debut album sound rather poppy, there are some beautiful songs and great musicianship on this early album, the sleeve notes by Tony Stratton Smith state &quot;Graham Field and the boys walked in off the street and laid a demo tape on me. It happens all the time. Only this time it was good, very good&quot;, quite something for the owner of a fledgling record company, a time of stiff competition, everything was a risk, especially a group with no lead guitarist -just keyboards, drums (timpani???) and bass!\n\n &quot;Iceberg&quot; sets the scene - a pacy intro, an icy beach, a haunting keyboard flurry, a ragged little husky - great song! &quot;Times&quot; is one of those poppy ones, followed by the extremely beautifully haunting &quot;You Went Away&quot; - long forgotten memories of lost love come flooding back. &quot;Melanie&quot; brightens things up, a whimsical little song about a frustrating girl we all knew!\n\n Side two kicks of with &quot;Beautiful Scarlet&quot;, this song really encapsulates the Rare Bird sound, a fast intro then drifts off into a dreamy, romantic world, the lyrics on this are really beautiful, about another lost love, who you &quot;were just happy following around..&quot;. &quot;Sympathy&quot; is next, the one hit single they had, about world peace - nothing's changed, there is still not enough love to go round. Incidentally the flip side of this single, &quot;Devil's High Concern&quot; is a fantastic heavy number which is sadly missing on my CD, i bought a copy of&quot;Sympathy&quot; and preferred this song on the B side!\n\n &quot;Nature's Fruit&quot; is a whimsical song about hawks, mice and flirting with your secretary - could that hawk be you? &quot;Bird on a Wing&quot; swings in next, it's like two songs in one, swaying nicely along, then speeds up into a boogie style groove, still observing that bird theme! One of my favourite songs on the album, it floats along nicely. The last track &quot;Gods of War&quot; is a in totally different mood - dark, threatening (the timpani comes in here), God-like whispered chants, a shepherd boy comes into sight - meets his fate! The track heads into a frenzied fast improvised jam before closing with the opening theme - epic stuff!\n\n I really enjoy listening to this album and can highly recommend it as a stunning debut for Rare Bird - an early Prog masterpiece and absolutely essential listening!\n\n &quot;Rare Bird are a rare find, innovative, original, deeply musical. They're on their own. TONY STRATTON SMITH.&quot;\n\n\nReview by mystic fred, progarchives.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aa469ba1375ba63ecabf5d0ceb45bae27868c84","amp;dn":"Rare+Bird+%26lrm%3B-+Rare+Bird+%281969%29+24bit%2F96khz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aa469ba1375ba63ecabf5d0ceb45bae27868c84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,164,105,186,19,117,186,99,236,171,245,208,206,180,91,174,39,134,140,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
