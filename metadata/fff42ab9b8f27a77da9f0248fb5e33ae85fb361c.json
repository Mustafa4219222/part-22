Fool (Brandon Adams), an African-American teen, breaks into the home of the wealthy landlords who evicted his family from a ghetto tenement. A fortune in gold coins is rumored to exist inside, but Fool discovers that the mansion is a chamber of horrors presided over by a pair of incestuous, serial killer siblings (Everett McGill and Wendy Robie). The twisted couple has also tried to raise a succession of kidnapped boys. Each botched effort is handled the same way -- the victim&amp;#039;s eyes, ears and tongues are removed, and he&amp;#039;s sent to live in the sealed-off basement, where a colony of similarly deformed &quot;brothers&quot; resides. Fool is able to avoid the evil lovers as he moves through the house&amp;#039;s maze of hidden passageways. He discovers that the occupants have a daughter, Alice (A.J. Langer), who has survived their abuse, so he rescues her and they attempt to free the &quot;people under the stairs.&quot; Adams, who made his feature debut with in film, was familiar to viewers as the star of rock singer Michael Jackson&amp;#039;s Moonwalker (1988). ~ Karl Williams, All Movie Guide\n\nFull DVD5 no compression\n\nSpecial Wes Craven at:\nwww.mundovob.eu/foro\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fff42ab9b8f27a77da9f0248fb5e33ae85fb361c","amp;dn":"The+People+Under+the+Stairs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fff42ab9b8f27a77da9f0248fb5e33ae85fb361c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,244,42,185,184,242,122,119,218,159,2,72,251,94,51,174,133,251,54,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
