Eaton teams up with Ace Daggett who plans to doublecross him and get the gold for himself. They frame Tom for murder and then try to get him to sign over his claim. The famous scout Tex Houston is on hand, escaping the attempts on his life, saving Mary from various perils, and trying to bring in the real killer and clear Tom. \n\nA partial remake of Universal's Heroes of the West (1932), this 15 chapter serial was based on pulp writer Peter B. Kyne's The Tie That Binds. Burly Johnny Mack Brown played an Indian scout who helps Tom Grant (Ralph Bowman) and his sister Mary (Eleanor Hansen) fight off a gang of outlaws out to steal their potentially valuable gold mine. Young Bowman later changed his name to John Archer. He was the father of actress Anne Archer. Although defeated in the final chapter, &quot;Duel to the Death,&quot; chief villain Charles B. Middleton was offered more than adequate support from Universal, who hired some of the best black hats in the business, including Charles King, Edward Cassidy, Roy Barcroft, Jim Corey, Iron Eyes Cody, Blackjack Ward, Frank LaRue, and the ubiquitous Charles &quot;Slim&quot; Whitaker.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 2:00:01\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 2:00:01\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:081f4feb1a02cc3d3f696689476b40afa0d2785b","amp;dn":"Flaming+Frontiers+%281938%29+Xvid+2cd+-+Western+Serial+-+Disk+2+of+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"081f4feb1a02cc3d3f696689476b40afa0d2785b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,31,79,235,26,2,204,61,63,105,102,137,71,107,64,175,160,210,120,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
