This book, drawn in the ukiyo-e style (world of floating pictures), presents &quot;The Yellow Jar&quot; which centers around a simple fisherman and a beautiful maiden he takes as wife, after finding her in a magic jar. However, she is abducted by a demon warrior considerably more powerful than the simple fisherman. But the fisherman's resolve, even after many unsuccessful attempts to rescue her, does not flinch. In &quot;Two Chrysanthemum Maidens&quot;, a monk is faced with two rather strange wild flowers in his carefully tended garden. They are wild and have planted themselves there at will. They are weeds but they are lovely like women.
