Thanks to cartoons and folk accounts we have a distorted view of these other humans - for that is what they were. We think of them as crude and clumsy and not very bright, easily driven to extinction by the lithe, smart modern humans that came out of Africa some 100,000 years ago.But was it really as simple as that? Clive Finlayson reminds us that the Neanderthals were another kind of human, and their culture was not so very different from that of our own ancestors. In this book, he presents a wider view of the events that led to the migration of the moderns into Europe, what might have happened during the contact of the two populations, and what finally drove the Neanderthals to extinction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc9dbcb611e35e2549efdc0ea5679d136e547ad","amp;dn":"The+Humans+Who+Went+Extinct%3AWhy+Neanderthals+died+out+and+we+sur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc9dbcb611e35e2549efdc0ea5679d136e547ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,201,219,203,97,30,53,226,84,158,253,192,234,86,121,209,54,229,71,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
