The appraisal of energy technologies and projects is complex and uncertain as the related decision making has to encompass environmental, technical, economic and social factors and information sources. The scientific procedure of assessment has a vital role as it can supply the right tools to evaluate the actual situation and make realistic forecasts of the effects and outcomes of any actions undertaken. Assessment and Simulation Tools for Sustainable Energy Systems offers reviews of the main assessment and simulation methods used for effective energy assessment.\r\n\r\nDivided across three sections, Assessment and Simulation Tools for Sustainable Energy Systems develops the readerâ€™s ability to select suitable tools to support decision making and implementation of sustainable energy projects. The first is dedicated to the analysis of theoretical foundations and applications of multi-criteria decision making. This is followed by chapters concentrating on the theory and practice of fuzzy inference, neural nets and algorithms genetics. Finally, simulation methods such as Monte Carlo analysis, mathematical programming and others are detailed.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive illustration of these tools and their application makes Assessment and Simulation Tools for Sustainable Energy Systems a key guide for researchers, scientists, managers, politicians and industry professionals developing the field of sustainable energy systems. It may also prompt further advancements in soft computing and simulation issues for students and researchers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4ee14a1a79c173408200f0fbf02ed04a4b7117","amp;dn":"Assessment+and+Simulation+Tools+for+Sustainable+Energy+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4ee14a1a79c173408200f0fbf02ed04a4b7117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,78,225,74,26,121,193,115,64,130,0,240,251,240,46,208,74,75,113,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
