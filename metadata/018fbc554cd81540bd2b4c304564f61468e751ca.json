Hardy-Fanta examines critical gender differences in how politics is defined, what strategies Latina women and Latino men use to generate political participation, and how culture and gender interact in the political empowerment of the ethic communities.\n\nHardy-Fanta challenges the notion of political apathy among Latinos and presents factors that stimulate political participation. She finds that the vision of politics promoted by Latina womenÃ¢â‚¬â€one based on connectedness, collectivity, community, and consiousness-raisingÃ¢â‚¬â€contrasts sharply with a male political concern for status, hierarchy, and personal opportunity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:018fbc554cd81540bd2b4c304564f61468e751ca","amp;dn":"Latina+Politics%2C+Latino+Politics%3A+Gender%2C+Culture%2C+and...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"018fbc554cd81540bd2b4c304564f61468e751ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,143,188,85,76,216,21,64,189,43,76,48,69,100,246,20,104,231,81,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
