(Previously published as The Emperor's Gold) July 1805: Napoleon's army masses across the Channel - Britain is within hours of invasion and defeat. Only one thing stands in the way - an obscure government bureau of murky origins and shadowy purpose: The Comptrollerate General for Scrutiny and Survey. And, rescued from a shipwreck, his past erased, Tom Roscarrock is their newest agent. In England, the man who recruited Roscarrock has disappeared, his agents are turning up dead, and reports of a secret French fleet are panicking the authorities. In France, a plan is underway to shatter the last of England's stability. Behind the clash of fleets and armies, there lies a secret world of intrigue, deception, treachery and violence - and Roscarrock is about to be thrown into it headfirst.\nUnabridged.\nRead by Cameron Stewart.\n\n---------------------------\nVisit us for this and more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n---------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17244b18c00671926958c87ab7b4baf372217058","amp;dn":"Treason%26rsquo%3Bs+Tide+-+Robert+Wilton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17244b18c00671926958c87ab7b4baf372217058","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,36,75,24,192,6,113,146,105,88,200,122,183,180,186,243,114,33,112,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
