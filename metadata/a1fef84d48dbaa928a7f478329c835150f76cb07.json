Using new technology in printing, paper-making and binding, publishers worked with authors and illustrators to meet ever-growing and more varied demands from a population seeking books at all price levels. The essays by leading book historians in this volume show how books became cheap, how publishers used the magazine and newspaper markets to extend their influence, and how book ownership became universal for the first time. The fullest account ever published of the nineteenth-century revolution in printing, publishing and bookselling, this volume brings the Cambridge History of the Book in Britain up to a point when the world of books took on a recognisably modern form.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1fef84d48dbaa928a7f478329c835150f76cb07","amp;dn":"The+Cambridge+History+of+the+Book+in+Britain%2C+Vol.+6_+1830-1914+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1fef84d48dbaa928a7f478329c835150f76cb07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,254,248,77,72,219,170,146,138,127,71,131,41,200,53,21,15,118,203,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
