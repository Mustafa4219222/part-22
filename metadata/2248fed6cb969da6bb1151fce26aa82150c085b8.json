The film was shot throughout Canada and United States including: Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho, British Columbia and Washington. The idea for the name originated from an 1852 Matthew Arnold poem entitled &quot;The Buried Life&quot;.\n\nOn April 18, 2009 an article in The New York Times announced that a serial television version of their documentary entited &quot;The Buried Life&quot; was chosen by MTV for development. The show has been selected as a flagship reality program that will usher in MTV's shift away from the superficial content currently dominating the network's programming towards the production of more socially conscious media. The network has ordered eight weekly half-hour episodes.\n\nAbout this episode:\n\n&quot;We never expected this episode to see the light of day. It's one of the more &quot;Hollywood&quot; items on the list and required a ridiculous plan to attempt to cross off. When Playboy found out what happened, they didn't want us to air it. Our last hope was a hand-written note to Hugh Hefner. It took us 4 hours to write and with it we sent a copy of the episode you'll see tonight. It took a while to get a response, but eventually he said yes.&quot;\n\n---\n\nSource by Dvsky, 2-pass compression\n\n   General\n\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 115 MiB\n      Duration : 21mn 14s\n      Overall bit rate : 755 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n   Video\n\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Streaming Video@L1\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 21mn 14s\n      Bit rate : 617 Kbps\n      Width : 544 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.125\n      Stream size : 93.8 MiB (82%)\n      Writing library : XviD 50\n\n   Audio\n\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 21mn 14s\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 124 Kbps\n      Minimum bit rate : 135 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 18.9 MiB (16%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 537 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : ABR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2248fed6cb969da6bb1151fce26aa82150c085b8","amp;dn":"The+Buried+Life+S01E01+WS+DSR+Xvid-Dodecahedron+%5BDodecahedron%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2248fed6cb969da6bb1151fce26aa82150c085b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,72,254,214,203,150,157,166,187,17,81,252,226,106,168,33,80,192,133,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
