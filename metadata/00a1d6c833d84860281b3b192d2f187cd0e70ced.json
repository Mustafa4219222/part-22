And even when it becomes clear that her daughter Charlotte is missing, Eve refuses to involve the police, insisting that her child's diappearance is simply a ploy, however despicable, by Luxford to bring down the Tory government.\n\nIt is only when events escalate to unbearable heights that New Scotland Yard, in the guise of Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and his partner Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, are brought in.

But before long, Joel has his own problems with a local gang. To protect his family, he makes a pact with the devil-; a move that leads straight to the front doorstep of Thomas Lynley.\n\nThe anatomy of a murder, the story of a family in crisis, What Came Before He Shot Her is a powerful, emotional novel that only the incomparable Elizabeth George could write.\n\nElizabeth George - Careless in Red (Book 15 in the Inspector Lynley series)\n\nIn her most eagerly anticipated novel yet, Elizabeth George brings back Scotland Yard's Thomas Lynley to investigate a ruthless crime.\n\nAfter the senseless murder of his wife, Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley retreated to Cornwall, where he has spent six solitary weeks hiking the bleak and rugged coastline. But no matter how far he walks, no matter how exhausting his days, the painful memories of Helen's death do not diminish.\n\nOn the forty-third day of his walk, at the base of a cliff, Lynley discovers the body of a young man who appears to have fallen to his death. The closest town, better known for its tourists and its surfing than its intrigue, seems an unlikely place for murder. However, it soon becomes apparent that a clever killer is indeed at work, and this time Lynley is not a detective but a witness and possibly a suspect.\n\nThe head of the vastly understaffed local police department needs Lynley's help, though, especially when it comes to the mysterious, secretive woman whose cottage lies not far from where the body was discovered. But can Lynley let go of the past long enough to solve a most devious and carefully planned crime?\n\nElizabeth George - This Body of Death (Book 16 in the Inspector Lynley series)\n\nWhile DI Thomas Lynley is still on compassionate leave after the murder of his wife, Isabelle Ardery is brought into the Met as his temporary replacement. The discovery of a body in a Stoke Newington cemetery offers Isabelle the chance to make her mark with a high profile murder investigation. Persuading Lynley back to work seems the best way to guarantee a result: Lynley's team is fiercely loyal to him and Isabelle needs them - and especially Barbara Havers - on side. The Met is twitchy: a series of PR disasters has undermined its confidence. Isabelle knows that she'll be operating under the unforgiving scrutiny of the media, so is quick -- perhaps too quick - to pin the murder on a convenient suspect. The murder trail leads Lynley and Havers to the New Forest, and the eventual resolution of the case. Its roots are in a long-ago act of violence that has poisoned subsequent generations and its outcome is both tragic and shocking.\n\nElizabeth George - The Evidence Exposed\n\nThis text contains three tales: &quot;The Evidence Exposed&quot;, a course brings together a group of enthusiasts; &quot;I, Richard&quot;, Malcolm Cousins has spent years in pursuit of a letter, but will he kill for it?; and &quot;The Surprise of His Life&quot;, Douglas Armstrong has his first consultation with Thistle McCloud.\n\nElizabeth George - 100 Years of Crime Stories by Women\n\nWhether the story is a murder mystery, a tale of suspense, a psychological study of the characters affected by a devastating event, a courtroom drama, a police procedural ... the question remains the same. Why crime? Why exists this fascination with crime and why, above all, exists this fascination with crime on the part of female writers?\n-- Elizabeth George\n\nIn A MOMENT ON THE EDGE, bestselling author Elizabeth George has selected a stunning collection of twenty-six crime stories from some of the best practitioners of the genre, who also happen to be some of the most successful women writers of our time.\n\nThese shocking and compulsively readable stories are arranged chronologically, starting with the classic &quot;A Jury of Her Peers&quot; by Susan Glaspell (1917). Also included are stories by Golden Age mystery writers Dorothy L Sayers and Ngaio Marsh, and New Golden Age author Sara Paretsky, as well as selections by writers outside the genre, such as Shirley Jackson, Nadine Gordimer, Antonia Fraser, and Joyce Carol Oates.\n\nCollectively these stories illustrate how crimefiction -- especially that written by women about women -- has changed in the last hundred years. As Elizabeth George notes in her introduction, &quot;All of these authors share in common a desire to explore mankind in a moment on the edge. The edge equates to the crime committed. How the characters deal with the edge is the story.&quot;\n\nThis is a must-have anthology for aficionados of crime fiction.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a1d6c833d84860281b3b192d2f187cd0e70ced","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+George+-++The+Inspector+Lynley+Series+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a1d6c833d84860281b3b192d2f187cd0e70ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,161,214,200,51,216,72,96,40,27,59,25,45,47,24,124,208,231,12,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
