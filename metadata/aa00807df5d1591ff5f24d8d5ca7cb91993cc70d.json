This collection of a dozen songs for a rainy Sunday begins with a single solitary piano note and Fretwell's nasal North of England accent on &quot;Do You Want to Come With?&quot; The album's air of melancholy never really clears, and if Fretwell's comparative youth and inexperience is evident in some strained lyrical imagery, his imagination and ear for a good tune also manifests itself on songs like the worldly wise &quot;Bad Bad You, Bad Bad Me&quot; and the homespun &quot;Lines.&quot;\n\nUK version features two bonus tracks. Debut album from the Salford-based singer/songwriter is very infectious with echoes of Dylan throughout. Stephen Fretwell writes music that you don't mind having stuck in your head.
