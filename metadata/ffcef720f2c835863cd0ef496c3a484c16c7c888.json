Every Day Is Exactly the Same\n\n2.  The Hand That Feeds (DFA Mix) \n\n3.  The Hand That Feeds (Photek Straight Mix)\n\n4.  Only (El-P Mix)\n\n5.  Only (Richard X Mix)\n\n6.  Every Day Is Exactly the Same (Sam Fog vs. Carlos D Mix)\n\n\n\nAll MP3 tracks have ID3 tags for Album, Artist, Track Titles, and order in the album.  Some other information, such as Year, Genre, and Publisher may have been added if the information was available to me.\n\nFLAC cannot be encoded by my software in a usable fashion with tags, so you must add them yourself. I am using FreeRip right now, which does not create .cue or log files. Once I finish learning my way around EAC, I will switch over and my FLAC uploads will contain these files.\n\nAll albums will have album art included if it was available to me.\n\nAll MP3 files that I upload are encoded at TRUE 320 kbps.\n\nAll FLAC files that I upload are encoded at highest quality.  If the files seem a little large, that is why. \n\nIf you have any problems, comments, or suggestions, let me know. \n\nIF YOU NEED FOR ME TO RESEED, contact me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6f1c1806091b0d00182f160e070000410c0002&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy, and seed, Seed, SEED!\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffcef720f2c835863cd0ef496c3a484c16c7c888","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Every+Day+Is+Exactly+The+Same+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffcef720f2c835863cd0ef496c3a484c16c7c888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,206,247,32,242,200,53,134,60,208,239,73,108,58,72,76,22,199,200,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
