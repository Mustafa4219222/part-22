It is the only Hendrix studio \nalbum professionally produced under his supervision. It topped the Billboard 200 album chart for \ntwo weeks in November 1968.The original North American-only Reprise release album cover featured \na &quot;fiery&quot; photo of Hendrix' head. The slightly later Track/Polydor International album release cover\ncontroversially, was a photo of a group of nude women, which was only replaced after Experience \nHendrix took control of Hendrix' recordings. In most Francophone parts of Europe, Barclay Records \nused a cover showing a downward pointing arm at a very small photo of Hendrix' head...\n\n\n\n   1.
