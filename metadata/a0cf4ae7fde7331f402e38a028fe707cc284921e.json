Helping Christians put their faith into action for the glory of God, popular pastor John Piper is releasing this stand-alone edition of chapter 5 from his best-selling book Don't Waste Your Life. Piper teaches that risk is an action that opens us up to the possibility of loss or injury, but that living for Christ necessarily involves taking risks in faith, a road that ultimately leads to fullness of joy, the glory of God, and the good of others.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0cf4ae7fde7331f402e38a028fe707cc284921e","amp;dn":"Risk+is+Right+-+John+Piper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0cf4ae7fde7331f402e38a028fe707cc284921e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,207,74,231,253,231,51,31,64,46,56,160,40,254,112,124,194,132,146,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
