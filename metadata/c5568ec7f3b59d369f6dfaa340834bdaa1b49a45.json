He's also the perfect foil to Mobley, with whom he had played extensively since 1955. In fact, on each of his six opportunities, Hank has a slight edge over Byrd in melodic invention, emotive playing, and fullness of sound. This date would be some of Mobley's most impressive work for Blue Note prior to his taking Coltrane's place in the Miles Davis Quintet. \n\n\nTracklist:\n1.\tGhana (7:20)\n2.\tLittle Boy Blue (7:29)\n3.\tGate City (5:04)\n4.\tLex (7:38)\n5.\tBo (6:34)\n6.\tMy Girl Shirl (5:49)\n7.\tChild's Play (6:57)\n8.\tCarol (5:42)\n9.\tSoulful Kiddy (5:37)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5568ec7f3b59d369f6dfaa340834bdaa1b49a45","amp;dn":"Donald+Byrd+-+Byrd+in+Hand+%281959%29+%5B2002+Rudy+Van+Gelder+Remaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5568ec7f3b59d369f6dfaa340834bdaa1b49a45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,86,142,199,243,181,157,54,159,109,250,163,64,131,75,218,161,180,154,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
