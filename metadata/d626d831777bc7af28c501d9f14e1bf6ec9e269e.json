The art is great, and the interview is good too. I like the parts about what an asshole Bob Harras was as Editor-in-Chief at Marvel in the late 1990s, although Garney is too polite to say much you can read between the lines. The image here is a rejected Captain America cover where Cap is standing atop a mound of dead soldiers. The cover was redrawn with Cap atop a hill. This is dedicated to LeonardTSpock who uploaded a ton of the first 25 MM volumes for me awhile back. Credit to the original scanner!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d626d831777bc7af28c501d9f14e1bf6ec9e269e","amp;dn":"Modern+Masters+Volume+27+-+Ron+Garney+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d626d831777bc7af28c501d9f14e1bf6ec9e269e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,38,216,49,119,123,199,175,40,197,1,217,241,78,27,246,236,158,38,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
