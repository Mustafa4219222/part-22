When I read of some of you guys digging through your Bibles to share various passages that are of significance to both you and I, how can I walk away?  When I read of sisters connecting and sharing their love of music in a quirky way that I have, in some small and perhaps insignificant way contributed to, how can I walk away?  When I read all the wide-spread encouragement, how can I walk away?  When I read of people's excitement to see a new bundle being shared on a daily check of The Pirate Bay, how can I walk away?  When I read of Christians who specifically created an account here for no other reason than to share a few words with me, how can I walk away?\n\nYou guys aren't making this easy on me!  haha\n\nI'm still on the fence as to what direction I will go next.  But I do know one thing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I will continue to follow Him wherever He chooses to lead me.  I have devoted nearly every aspect of my life to serving the Lord, often times to the detriment of worldly gratification, often times to the disappointment of my own hearts desire, and often times to my personal well being.  But when I say &quot;I give it all to you Lord&quot;, I take that commitment seriously.  And I hope you do too.\n\nI am no different than any of you.  If you walked by me on the street, you likely wouldn't even take notice.  I know almost nothing about music, and I'm the first to admit it.  Even breaking down the genres is sometimes a challenge for me.  I've got no special music sharing stash, no inside connections.  But I'm willing to work extremely hard.  I'm willing to invest the time to dig in deep to gather this music if it means enriching the lives of people whom I will someday meet in His Kingdom.\n\nSo for now, I'll continue to share these bundles.  And what better day to share a 4th bundle for 2014 then on the Lord's Day.  So I spent some time this past weekend scratching and scraping together two gigs worth of music.  Revisiting website after website after website, looking for anything I might have missed since the beginning of the year.  And I think I am finally caught up.\n\nIf you've noticed a lot of singles in today's bundle, so have I.  I'm surprised by it, actually.  Of the 154 releases we've shared amongst ourselves so far this calandar year, I'm even more surprised that 60 of them were singles.  That's about 39%!\n\nYet hopefully something within today's bundle, whether it's a single or a full length album, will prove to be a blessing to you.  The few websites I use to rely on for Christian Jazz has disbanded.  But other than Jazz, I think I have a wide genre spread to offer everyone today.  I even had a chance to listen to some of it myself...\n\nI've always enjoyed AzarelStar as a female rapper.  You might remember her &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; album from bundle #34 way back in 2012.  But this HeeSun Lee rapper I'm sharing today is spot on too.  I've also listened to Bizzle and Lecrae nearly a dozen times on the &quot;You Know&quot; single that I'm sharing today.  And although I only landed a copy of it early this morning, the &quot;G Side Oldies&quot; (Various) is nice and covers songs ranging in genre from Soul, R&amp;B, Funk, Hip-Hop, etc.\n\nGOSPEL: Afy Douglas, Gerard Brooks, Thomas Warren Jr.  ROCK: Among The Thirsty, Drown Incus, Jordan Riley, Kat Marco, Sumerlin.
