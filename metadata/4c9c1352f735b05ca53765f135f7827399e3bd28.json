Ellie does her best to enjoy the holidays, even making new friends with Beatrice, a local shop keeper and Deputy Strode. Settling in nicely with her brother's family, Ellie agrees to watch her niece and nephew when Aaron travels out of town to purchase adjacent land for farming. But when a corrupt attorney in town leaves a young man to blame for Mayor Wayne's barn catching fire and burning, Ellie ignores distrusting townspeople and steps in to help to prove his innocence. To her dismay, the season's festivities are threatened when Aaron goes missing. When all seems lost, Ellie not only gets the perfect holiday miracle, her brother delivered home safely on Christmas morning, but also the chance at a new life when she finds herself falling in love again.\n\n\nTorrent por - Junio_Tk2\nLegendas por: Queens Of The Lab","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9c1352f735b05ca53765f135f7827399e3bd28","amp;dn":"Loves.Christmas.Journey.2011.HDTV-Junio_Tk2-Queens_of_The_Lab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9c1352f735b05ca53765f135f7827399e3bd28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,156,19,82,247,53,176,92,165,55,101,241,53,247,130,115,153,227,189,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
