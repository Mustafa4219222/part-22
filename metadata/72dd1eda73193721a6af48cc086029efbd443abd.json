It was included on the OS/2 Warp 4 box. \n\n------------------------------\n\nOS/2 is a computer operating system, initially created by Microsoft and IBM, then later developed by IBM exclusively. The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72dd1eda73193721a6af48cc086029efbd443abd","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+4+-+9.023+-+English+-+Application+Sampler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72dd1eda73193721a6af48cc086029efbd443abd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,221,30,218,115,25,55,33,166,175,72,204,8,96,41,239,189,68,58,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
