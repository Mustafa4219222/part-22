The album cover design is from Alan Aldridge's design for a 1973 book based on the poem.\n\nThe work was originally conceived as a solo vehicle for Jon Lord to be produced by Roger Glover who had recently left Deep Purple. However, Lord proved too busy with Deep Purple and Glover took up the reins on his own. Using his connections, Glover recruited a large cast of noted rock musicians to perform on it, with a different vocalist for each character, including David Coverdale and Glenn Hughes. The single &quot;Love Is All&quot;, with vocals from Ronnie James Dio, made a minor impression in the UK but reached number one in The Netherlands. \n\nn 16 October 1975, a one-off performance at the Royal Albert Hall took place. Again it had a star-studded cast of rock musicians, most notably Ian Gillan who was drafted in at the last minute and received a standing ovation on his entrance. He replaced an unavailable Ronnie James Dio who had commitments with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (although Dio did eventually get to perform the song at the Royal Albert Hall in 1999 as the guest of Deep Purple). Gillan had not performed since leaving Deep Purple in 1973. Also notable was the appearance of Twiggy as singer and actress and Vincent Price as narrator. Apart from most of the musicians involved in the studio recording, the concert also featured Jon Lord. The live concert was filmed and released in 1976 produced by Tony Klinger.\n\nTrack listing\nOriginal Album\n\n    &quot;Dawn&quot; (Glover) 1:21\n    &quot;Get Ready&quot; (Glover) 2:06\n    &quot;Saffron Dormouse and Lizzy Bee&quot; (Glover) 1:25\n    &quot;Harlequin Hare&quot; (Glover/Dio/Soule) 1:26\n    &quot;Old Blind Mole&quot; (Glover) 1:11\n    &quot;Magician Moth&quot; (Glover) 1:33\n    &quot;No Solution&quot; (Glover) 3:28\n    &quot;Behind the Smile&quot; (Glover) 1:46\n    &quot;Fly Away&quot; (Glover) 2:22\n    &quot;Aranea&quot; (Glover) 1:37\n    &quot;Sitting in a Dream&quot; (Glover) 3:40\n    &quot;Waiting&quot; (Glover) 3&quot;11\n    &quot;Sir Maximus Mouse&quot; (Glover) 2:35\n    &quot;Dreams of Sir Bedivere&quot; () 4:09\n    &quot;Together Again&quot; (Glover/Dio/Soule) 2:05\n    &quot;Watch Out for the Bat&quot; (Glover) 1:41\n    &quot;Little Chalk Blue&quot; (Glover/Hardin) 3:44 CD Reissue only\n    &quot;The Feast&quot; (Glover) 1:48\n    &quot;Love Is All&quot; (Glover/Hardin/Dio) 3:14\n    &quot;Homeward&quot; (Glover/Hardin) 4:12\n\nPersonnel Original Album\n\n    Tony Ashton - vocals on track 15\n    Les Binks - drums\n    Helen Chappelle - vocals on track 3\n    David Coverdale - vocals on track 10\n    Ronnie James Dio - vocals on tracks 11, 19 and 20\n    Jack Emblow - accordion\n    Ray Fenwick - guitar\n    Mo Foster - bass guitar, double bass, fingerpops\n    Kay Garner - backing vocals\n    Michael Giles - drums\n    Roger Glover - synthesiser piano, guitar, bass guitar, percussion, backing vocals\n    John Goodison - vocals on track 5\n    John Gustafson - vocals on track 16\n    Eddie Hardin - keyboards, vocals on track 13 and background vocals\n    Jimmy Helms - vocals on track 12\n    Glenn Hughes - vocals on track 2\n    Eddie Jobson - violin\n    Chris Karan - tabla\n    Judi Kuhl - vocals on track 10 and backing vocals\n    Neil Lancaster - vocals on track 4\n    John Lawton - vocals on track 17\n    Mike Moran - piano\n    Ann Odell - piano\n    Mickey Lee Soule - vocals on track 7\n    Barry St. John - vocals on track 3\n    Liza Strike - vocals on track 9\n    Robin Thompson - bassoon\n    Nigel Watson - saw\n    Joanne Williams - backing vocals\n    The Mountain Fjord Orchestra led by David Woodcock and conducted by Martin Ford, John Bell and Del Newman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc775255ec2cce30aed0164092f4c7b9455d5698","amp;dn":"Roger+Glover+%2B+Guests+-+The+Butterfly+Ball+and+the+Grasshopper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc775255ec2cce30aed0164092f4c7b9455d5698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,119,82,85,236,44,206,48,174,208,22,64,146,244,199,185,69,93,86,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
