Their constant companions, the fur-covered humanoids who were their Bre'n mentors, alone could channel and control Senyas power. Yet together they had failed to save Deva, an inferno devoured by its greedy sun.\n\nTwo survivors - and perhaps more? Rheba, the fire dancer, and Kirtn, her Bre'n, swore to search the known - and unknown - universe for others of their kind. And though they knew the danger, they courted the attention and fell into the clutches of the dreaded Loo-chim, galactic slavers from whose clutches none escaped alive . . .\n\nBut then the Loo-chim had never encountered a Fire Dancer in her power and glory . . .\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ee07893c46bb58f65ae9d04a9f6963fbab81bb","amp;dn":"Ann+Maxwell+%2F+Elizabeth+Lowell%2C+Fire+Dancer+Trilogy+%5Bnew+scan%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ee07893c46bb58f65ae9d04a9f6963fbab81bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,238,7,137,60,70,187,88,246,90,233,208,74,159,105,99,251,171,129,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
