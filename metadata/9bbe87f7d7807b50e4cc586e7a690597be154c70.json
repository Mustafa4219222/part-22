All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as they could conflict or cause damage if run concurrently. The Microsoft Office Setup Customization Functions (Customize Setup Tab), AutoKMS Uninstaller (if AutoKMS is installed), AutoRearm Uninstaller (if AutoRearm is installed), Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Microsoft Office or Windows is not installed/supported.

A BETA of mine is usually just bug testing and last minute feature additions.\n-Currently using OTK changelog/Readme.\n\nIdeas\n-I would like to add OEM abilities of some sort, so as to bring back the License tab when under windows. Perhaps with permission EZ-Activator could trigger a Windows Loader installation for OS that cannot use KMS activation but either have a BIOS with SLIC or just run the loader (Have to ask Daz about this).\n-Possibly create a Windows AutoRearm equivalent, rather unlikely as if a PE boot is required then it would just be another IR5, the other known way is PMR method.\n\nReadme:\nClick The Readme Button in Office 2010 Toolkit program, and Copy Button to copy the tabbed section contents.\n\n\nCredits:\nCredits - Developers:\nCODYQX4\nBosh\n\nCredits - Other:\nletsgoawayhell for how to install and obtain Office 2010 license files needed for License Add/Convert.\nZWT for the Original KMS Keygen, and Phazor and letsgoawayhell for KMS research/improvements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bbe87f7d7807b50e4cc586e7a690597be154c70","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Toolkit+2.4.3+Stable+-+KurdTM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bbe87f7d7807b50e4cc586e7a690597be154c70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,190,135,247,215,128,123,80,228,204,88,110,122,105,5,151,190,21,76,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
