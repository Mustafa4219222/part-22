He is possibly best known for his collaboration with guitarists Stfean Grossman and Bert Jansch as well as his work with the folk group Pentangle, although he maintained a solo career both before, during and after that band's existence (1967-1973).\n\nWhile most commonly labelled a folk musician, Renbourn's musical tastes and interests take in early music, classical music, blues and world music.\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Renbourn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Renbourn&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWhat follows is a collection of some of his albums.. enjoy...\n\n______________________\n\n\nJohn Renbourn  - Will the circle be unbroken\nJohn Renbourn - Another Monday\nJohn Renbourn - Faro Annie\nJohn Renbourn - John Renbourn\nJohn Renbourn &amp; Stefan Grossman - The Three Kingdoms\nJohn Renbourn - The Essential John Renbourn\nJohn Renbourn - The Hermit\nJohn Renbourn - The Lady and the Unicorn\nJohn Renbourn - The Nine Maidens\nJohn Renbourn - Live in Italy\nStefan Grossman &amp; John Renbourn - Under the volcano\nJohn Renbourn &amp; Duck Baker - a thousand words\nJohn Renbourn - 1968 Sir John Alot\nJohn Renbourn - The Black Balloon\nJohn Renbourn - Traveller's Prayer\nJohn Renbourn Group - A Maid In Bedlam\nJohn Renbourn Group - live in america\nJohn Renbourn Group - The Enchanted Garden\nJohn Renbourn Group - Ship Of Fools\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n)\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bcd49242a979bd03c15003a6d6f0d000eb014c5","amp;dn":"Guitar+Masters+04+of+16+John+Renbourn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bcd49242a979bd03c15003a6d6f0d000eb014c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,205,73,36,42,151,155,208,60,21,0,58,109,111,13,0,14,176,20,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
