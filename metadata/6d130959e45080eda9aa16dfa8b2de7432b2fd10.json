His live lecture is open and friendly; he radiates acceptance and confidence. Quoting great philosophers, mystics, and theologians, he teaches--almost preaches--a way to inner peace and knowledge. LeShan, a charismatic teacher, reads as if he is speaking to one listener only, not a sizeable audience. Unfortunately, the recording is padded and overexplained by a generic voice-over (Paul Michael) sporadically interrupting with studio-recorded text, which has all the charm of an instruction manual. But LeShan&amp;#039;s live material is worth the price of admission.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d130959e45080eda9aa16dfa8b2de7432b2fd10","amp;dn":"How+to+meditate+Lawrence+LeShan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d130959e45080eda9aa16dfa8b2de7432b2fd10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,19,9,89,228,80,128,237,169,170,22,223,168,178,222,116,50,178,253,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
