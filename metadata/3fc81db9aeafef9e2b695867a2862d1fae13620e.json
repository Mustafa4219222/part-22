With his sensitive take on humanity and his completely original artistic vision, we expect this thoughtful tale of early Japan to prove quite popular. It has been several thousand years since the end of the last ice age. The waters have warmed and risen, excising great portions of East Asia, while simultaneously creating the cluster of islands we now know as Japan. Across this modest new body of water came many immigrants. Some sought freedom. Some sought fortune. When Sun Kim came from Korea to Kyuushuu, the southern-most of the four largest islands of Japan, she was simply looking for a fresh start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc81db9aeafef9e2b695867a2862d1fae13620e","amp;dn":"Scott+Mills+-+Big+Clay+Pot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc81db9aeafef9e2b695867a2862d1fae13620e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,200,29,185,174,175,239,158,43,105,88,103,162,134,45,31,174,19,98,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
