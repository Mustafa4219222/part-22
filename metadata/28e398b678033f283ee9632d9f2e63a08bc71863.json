Amanda is now running Division but Oversight has assigned one of their own, a new agent named Sean, to keep an eye on her. Amanda's first mission is to get back the black box from Nikita, and she enlists Alex's help to do so. Alex refuses until Amanda tells her she will help her find the man who killed Alex's father. Meanwhile, Nikita and Michael find help from an unlikely ally.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 2: Falling Ash\n\nWhile investigating an old corrupt Division program, P9, that seems to have resurfaced, Nikita and Michael run into Owen. He tells them he is searching for Dr. Joseph Mars, who is not only the mastermind behind P9, but also invented the Regimen and could help Owen wean himself off the dangerous drug. Michael is hesitant to trust Owen again but Nikita decides the three should join forces. Percy demands to see Alex.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 3: Knightfall\n\nBirkoff tells Nikita and Michael that a black box file reveals that an international terrorist named Ramon, who has been taking credit for some serious political assassinations, now works for Division. This news upsets Nikita since she was the agent that captured Ramon years ago and turned him over to Percy. Amanda convinces Alex to kill Anton Kochenko, a man who used to work for Alex's father, and plans to let Ramon take the credit for the murder. However, when Nikita disrupts Amanda's plan, Amanda fights back by taking what Nikita loves most.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 4: Partners\n\nNikita is stunned when she hears that her old Division partner Kelly escaped from a Turkish prison. Nikita thought Kelly died years ago and always felt responsible because it happened on the mission where Nikita escaped from Division. Knowing Amanda will go after Kelly, Nikita tells Michael they have to go to Turkey to help her. Amanda sends Alex and Roan to Europe to stop the former partners from reuniting.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 5: Looking Glass\n\nMichael discovers Cassandra, a woman he once romanced under Division orders, is in danger. Feeling guilty for how things ended, he wants to help her but Nikita suspects there is more to it than easing his conscience. Amanda manipulates Alex into helping her on a mission but Sean gets caught in Amanda's web of lies and begins to doubt Division's true motives.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 6: 343 Walnut Lane\n\nWhile searching for information on the black box, Birkoff stumbles upon NikitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s birth certificate. Nikita and Michael track down NikitaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s father Richard, but the reunion is not quite what Nikita expected.

Meanwhile, Alex is being tailed by Gogol, and comes face to face with someone from her past.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 8: London Calling\n\nMichael becomes alarmed when he hears Cassandra is in trouble and rushes off to help her. He discovers General Tupelov has accused her of stealing two million dollars and has threatened to kill her unless she returns it. However, when Cassandra's story doesn't add up, Nikita becomes suspicious of what she might be hiding. Meanwhile, Alex receives a very tempting offer from Percy that could give her the resources to eliminate Semak.\n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 9: Fair Trade\n\nNikita steals funds from Oversight, forcing them to host an emergency meeting. Nikita and Birkoff figure out how to spy on the meeting so Nikita can identify the other members of Oversight, but things go awry and Sean captures Birkoff. Amanda demands to know where Nikita is hiding but Birkoff refuses to give up his friend so she tortures him. Meanwhile, Alex sets her plan in motion to reclaim her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s empire. With a price on her head, Alex realizes the easiest way to get into Russia undetected is the same way she was smuggled out ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ through the illegal sex ring. \n\n\n\nSeizoen 2 Aflevering 10: Guardians\n\nWith Michael out of town, Nikita turns to Owen to help her track down and steal another black box from a Guardian. Unfortunately, she discovers that Owen is working for an unlikely employer that could jeopardize Nikita's whole operation.
