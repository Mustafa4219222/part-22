You may be new to the world of paycheck-to-paycheck broke-ass living but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a very big community, populated with every kind of ethnicity, nationality, religion and class. How we get through is with a little help from our friends and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what this book is about. How we make great family dinners work with little to nothing is what I am going to teach you. I do not claim these recipes to be gourmet. Some are simple, &quot;Why didn't I think of that?&quot; recipes. Most are designed to be quick, &quot;We've got 20 minutes, what can I make?&quot; type of meals. Simple foods, quick preparation, kid-pleasers are what we focus on. Season as you like, get creative or just prepare as written, it's really up to you. The recipes contained are hearty meals for growing families, they are time tested and will feed a family of 4 for pennies a day. Because this book is for hard working struggling families a portion of the proceeds of the sale of this book go to families in need.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c657d5398379c5ed9c1c6579dfd2ae0c827dfe","amp;dn":"The+Broke-Ass+Cookbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c657d5398379c5ed9c1c6579dfd2ae0c827dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,198,87,213,57,131,121,197,237,156,28,101,121,223,210,174,12,130,125,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
