Janssen has published: 'The Plain truth About God-101 (what the church doesn't want you to know).' God-101 presents a fascinating insight into how the original 'cult' teachings of Jesus were altered by Greek philosophy, Pagan beliefs and Pauline thought to become the sayings of 'The Christ' and the basis of our modern Bible. God-101 gives an analysis of how the 'priesthood' has corrupted Christianity and the other major religions. It shows how 'Dogma' has led to the polarization of different sects within the same religion, (Catholic/Protestant - Shiite/Sunni) and how religious strife affects society as a whole, including the upcoming world - wide clash between Christianity and Islam!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebc5cd534c9d47133ae493cc9a244341405d3b49","amp;dn":"The+Plain+Truth+About+God+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebc5cd534c9d47133ae493cc9a244341405d3b49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,197,205,83,76,157,71,19,58,228,147,204,154,36,67,65,64,93,59,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
