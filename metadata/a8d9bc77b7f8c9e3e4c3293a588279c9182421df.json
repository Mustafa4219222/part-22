Reunited with\n    original producer Aaron Sprinkle, the quintet flexes real musical muscle as\n    it explores themes both personal and political. The album transcends the\n    confines of emo-pop with hard-punching tracks powered by the punishing drum\n    work of Nathan Young. Stephen Christian continues to show an uncommon\n    ability to combine raw force with emotional nuance as lead singer. Searing\n    tunes like ÃƒÂ´Self-StarterÃƒÂ¶ and polished ballads like ÃƒÂ´InnocenceÃƒÂ¶ are\n    delivered with conviction. VitalÃƒâ€ s sonic mix of brawny ÃƒÂ¦90s-esque rock\n    guitar, well-sculpted melodies, and atmospheric electronica frames lyrics\n    that range from urgent anti-war pleas (ÃƒÂ´Someone AnyoneÃƒÂ¶) to prayerful\n    ruminations (ÃƒÂ´Other SideÃƒÂ¶) and angry breakup tirades (ÃƒÂ´Desires&quot;). The\n    showstopper here is the closing track, ÃƒÂ´God, Drugs &amp; Sex,ÃƒÂ¶ a darkly tender\n    dissection of a tormented relationship featuring the honeyed guest vocals of\n    Christie DuPree. Anberlin here achieves a heroic sound that should impress\n    old and new fans alike.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d9bc77b7f8c9e3e4c3293a588279c9182421df","amp;dn":"Anberlin-Vital_%28Best_Buy_Bonus_Tracks%29-2012-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d9bc77b7f8c9e3e4c3293a588279c9182421df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,217,188,119,183,248,201,227,228,195,41,58,88,130,121,201,24,36,33,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
