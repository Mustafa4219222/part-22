They find a welcoming offer of food and a bed, along with a not-so-subtle warning. Will Billy and the biological curiosities fall prey to the count's charms?\n\n'Eric's got a gift-if you consider gallows humor an admiral talent, which I do. He's written some sick stuff here, a number of 'whoa' moments, and he's lucky to have a partner that takes the 'whoa' and makes it 'WHOA!''-Brian Azzarello (100 Bullets)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7736620/Billy_the_Kid_s_Old_Timey_Oddities_and_the_Orm_of_Loch_Ness_01&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7736620/Billy_the_Kid_s_Old_Timey_Oddities_and_the_Orm_of_Loch_Ness_01&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58bb00da921874eac7edeea3f07f65e93a37f6f","amp;dn":"Billy+the+Kid%27s+Old+Timey+Oddities+and+the+Orm+of+Loch+Ness+%232+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58bb00da921874eac7edeea3f07f65e93a37f6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,139,176,13,169,33,135,78,172,126,222,234,63,7,246,94,147,163,127,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
