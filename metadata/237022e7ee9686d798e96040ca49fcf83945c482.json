Comes with liner notes. Jazz at the Plaza Vol. II is a live album by American pianist, composer and bandleader Duke Ellington recorded in 1958 at a party for Columbia Records and released on the label in 1973. The Miles Davis Sextet was also recorded at the same event and released as the first volume of Jazz at the Plaza. An intimate live session from Duke Ellington and his great late 50s orchestra Ã¢â‚¬â€œ presented here at a private party hosted by Columbia Records at the Plaza Hotel in New York Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at a time when Ellington was making some of his best music for the label! The tracks here are every bit on a par with Duke's late 50s gems for Columbia Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and have the orchestra stepping out strongly on short numbers that maybe have a bit more swing and a bit less overall concept Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the soloist shift, and shine nicely on each tune!\n\nThe set features great performances from Jimmy Hamilton on clarinet, Britt Woodman on trombone, Shorty Baker on trumpet, and Johnny Hodges on alto Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and also includes some very late vocal work from Billie Holiday, who sings on two tracks, plus two more from Jimmy Rushing as well. Titles include &quot;Love To Hear My Baby Call My Name&quot;, &quot;El Gato&quot;, &quot;All Of Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Explain&quot;, &quot;When Your Lover Has Gone&quot;, &quot;Red Garter&quot;, and &quot;Red Carpet&quot;.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01 - Jazz Festival Suite\n02 - Jones\n03 - El Gato\n04 - All Of Me\n05 - Go Away Blues - Hello, Little Girl - Love To Hear My Baby Call My Name\n06 - When Your Lover Has Gone - (Hush Now) Don't Explain\n07 - Take The ''A'' Train\n\n*2014 Columbia / Sony Music Japan | SICP 4243 | 2014 DSD remaster\n{2014 Japan Jazz Collection 1000 Columbia-RCA Series}\n\n\nPersonnel:\nDuke Ellington Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano\nCat Anderson, Shorty Baker, Buck Clayton, Ray Nance, Clark Terry - trumpet\nQuentin Jackson, Britt Woodman - trombone\nJohn Sanders - valve trombone\nJimmy Hamilton - clarinet, tenor saxophone\nRussell Procope - alto saxophone, clarinet\nJohnny Hodges, Bill Graham - alto saxophone\nPaul Gonsalves - tenor saxophone\nHarry Carney - baritone saxophone\nMal Waldron - piano\nJimmy Woode - bass\nSam Woodyard - drums\nJimmy Rushing, Billie Holiday - vocals\n\n\nComing soon...
