Full-color layouts presenting painters, street artists, sculptors, cartoonists, and photographers are featured along with interviews, rare portfolios, sketches, and reviews. Juxtapoz is the brainchild of Robert Williams, world-renowned artist and father of the widely popular school of cartoon surrealism. Target audience is teens to hip adults.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53eec5afe60559db47333b5c75e16e27ecd907c","amp;dn":"Juxtapoz+-+March+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53eec5afe60559db47333b5c75e16e27ecd907c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,62,236,90,254,96,85,157,180,115,51,181,199,94,22,226,126,205,144,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
