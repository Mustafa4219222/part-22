Now I Understand\n\nThe fluke smash hit of Lisa Loeb's debut single, &quot;Stay (I Missed You),&quot; in 1994 was a blessing since it gave her a career, but a curse since it defined her career. For many, she was just a one-hit wonder, and it took her a long time to shake that stigma as she kept cutting records and cultivating a cult audience. She lost her major-label deal in the process, but majors weren't suited for her anyway since it forced her to work on a scale that was too large for the modest music she made. In 2004, a decade after &quot;Stay,&quot; she had signed to Rounder's Zoe subsidiary, a better fit for her warm, low-key folk-pop and ballads, as The Way It Really Is, her first album for the label, proves. Quite simply, it's the best, most cohesive record she's made, a clean, crisp collection of well-crafted, gentle tunes that slowly, surely work into the subconscious. Loeb co-produced the album with her husband Dweezil Zappa, and they never overdress the songs, nor do they rely on Spartan, all-acoustic arrangements; they let the music breathe, sometimes adding layers of guitars and keyboards, sometimes keeping it to just her and another instrument or two. The Way It Really Is is still a quiet, modest album, but that's its appeal -- by being sounding so modest, Loeb's skills as a songwriter stand out, as do her charms as a singer. It's a sweet, ingratiating album, the first that she's made to truly deliver on the promise of &quot;Stay,&quot; the one that offers definitive proof that Loeb is more than a one-hit wonder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6678440a204516652034e07d4ee9eb1072af0789","amp;dn":"Lisa+Loeb+-+The+Way+It+Really+Is+%5B2004%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6678440a204516652034e07d4ee9eb1072af0789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,120,68,10,32,69,22,101,32,52,224,125,78,233,235,16,114,175,7,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
