Is the future of Earth to be fully domesticated, an engineered global garden managed by technocrats to serve humanity? The schism between advocates of rewilding and those who accept and even celebrate a Ã¢â‚¬Å“post-wildÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ world is arguably the hottest intellectual battle in contemporary conservation.\nIn Keeping the Wild, a group of prominent scientists, writers, and conservation activists responds to the Anthropocene-boosters who claim that wild nature is no more (or in any case not much worth caring about), that human-caused extinction is acceptable, and that Ã¢â‚¬Å“novel ecosystemsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are an adequate replacement for natural landscapes. With rhetorical fists swinging, the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributors argue that these Ã¢â‚¬Å“new environmentalistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ embody the hubris of the managerial mindset and offer a conservation strategy that will fail to protect life in all its buzzing, blossoming diversity.\nWith essays from Eileen Crist, David Ehrenfeld, Dave Foreman, Lisi Krall, Harvey Locke, Curt Meine, Kathleen Dean Moore, Michael SoulÃƒÂ©, Terry Tempest Williams and other leading thinkers, Keeping the Wild provides an introduction to this important debate, a critique of the Anthropocene boostersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ attack on traditional conservation, and unapologetic advocacy for wild nature.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;Keeping the Wild: Against the Domestication of Earth is an extraordinarily important book. It identifies the great and irreversible damage to Earth's biodiversity that will follow if the 'Anthropocene' ideology is allowed to stall the global conservation effort.&quot;(Edward O. Wilson University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University)\n\n&quot;...[T]he book contains thought-provoking and damning examples of how the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neo-greensÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ have abandoned the preservation of Nature in favor of human re-engineering of the earthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural ecosystems and dwindling wilderness.&quot;\n(The Helena Vigilante)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nGeorge Wuerthner is the ecological projects director for the Foundation for Deep Ecology, where he does research and writes about environmental issues.
