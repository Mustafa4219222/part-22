Originally from Tampa, Florida, he moved to New York in the mid 1950&amp;#039;s.The nickname &quot;Cannonball&quot; was a childhood nickname for the portly saxophonist, a corruption of &quot;cannibal&quot;. An articulate speaker with an easy manner, Cannonball educated, amused, and informed his audiences in clubs and on television about the art and moods of jazz (he was a music teacher before beginning his jazz career).
