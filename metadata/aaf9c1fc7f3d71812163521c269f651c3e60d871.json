I apologize, but wasn't involved in the project, so I guess it wasn't my fault :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPS: I only upload packs of complete series. If you see me uploading single issues, this means that regretfully, I don't have the series yet complete.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml  ).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr&quot; files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other translated Belgian/French comics, you can check my release thread:                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced. You can also indicate which series you rather want to read more of. Just comment on a torrent, rate the torrent or send me a message/PM on suprbay, and you'll be able to read it in about one month!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf9c1fc7f3d71812163521c269f651c3e60d871","amp;dn":"Bernard_Prince_T02_-_The_Rebels_of_Coronado.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf9c1fc7f3d71812163521c269f651c3e60d871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,249,193,252,127,61,113,129,33,99,82,28,38,159,101,28,62,96,216,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
