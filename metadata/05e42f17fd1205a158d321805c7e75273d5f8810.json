She didn't realize she was being tragic.\n\nOn the surface, Annie Powers's life in a wealthy Floridian suburb is happy and idyllic. Her husband, Gray, loves her fiercely; together, they dote on their beautiful young daughter, Victory. But the bubble surrounding Annie is pricked when she senses that the demons of her past have resurfaced and, to her horror, are now creeping up on her. These are demons she can't fully recall because of a highly dissociative state that allowed her to forget the tragic and violent episodes of her earlier life as Ophelia March and to start over, under the loving and protective eye of Gray, as Annie Powers. Disturbing events--the appearance of a familiar dark figure on the beach, the mysterious murder of her psychologist--trigger strange and confusing memories for Annie, who realizes she has to quickly piece them together before her past comes to claim her future and her daughter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05e42f17fd1205a158d321805c7e75273d5f8810","amp;dn":"Lisa+Unger+-+Black+Out+%28Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05e42f17fd1205a158d321805c7e75273d5f8810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,228,47,23,253,18,5,161,88,211,33,128,92,126,117,39,61,95,136,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
