In this way, cities will remain the focus of social organization, political management and cultural expression, equipped to deal with the enormous social and environmental problems of urbanization.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:505370798493ece01b9d4e889b04411019c690de","amp;dn":"Local+and+Global%2C+Management+of+Cities+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"505370798493ece01b9d4e889b04411019c690de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,83,112,121,132,147,236,224,27,157,78,136,155,4,65,16,25,198,144,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
