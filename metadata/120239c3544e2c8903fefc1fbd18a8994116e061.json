It was a year that pushed boundaries on stage (Oh! Calcutta!), screen (Midnight Cowboy), and the printed page (Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex), witnessed the genesis of the gay rights movement at Stonewall, and started the era of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“no faultÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ divorce. Richard Nixon became president, the New Left squared off against the Silent Majority, William Ayers co-founded the Weatherman Organization, and the nationwide Moratorium provided a unifying force in the peace movement.\n\nCompelling, timely, and quite simply a blast to read, 1969 chronicles the year through all its ups and downs, in culture and society, sports, music, film, politics, and technology. This is a book for those who survived 1969, or for those who simply want to feel as alive as those who lived through this time of amazing upheaval.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:120239c3544e2c8903fefc1fbd18a8994116e061","amp;dn":"1969+-+The+Year+Everything+Changed+%28History+Society+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"120239c3544e2c8903fefc1fbd18a8994116e061","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,2,57,195,84,78,44,137,3,254,252,31,189,24,168,153,65,22,224,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
