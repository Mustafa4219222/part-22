One should always be glad that Superman sees himself as the good scout otherwise the DC Earth would truly be hell.&quot;  (SFCrowsnest.org.uk, 1 June 2013)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“And this delightfully appealing tome does exactly thatÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  (Comics Review, 25 April 2013)\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\nSuperman may not have been the first superhero, but ever since his introduction in Action Comics #1 in 1938, he has been the model for every superhero to follow. For 75 years Superman has thrilled millions with his adventures in comic books, television shows, and movies. His popularity transcends all borders because he strikes so many universal themes, such as justice and strength, moral responsibility, identity, and the heroic ideals of perfection, goodness, and nobility.\n\nBut he also raises significant philosophical dilemmas. If Superman is that good, for example, why does he so often resort to violence? Could Lex Luthor be right in telling us Superman is the real threat to humanity? Is Superman the realization of NietzscheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ÃƒÅ“bermenschÃ¢â‚¬â€and is that a good or bad thing? And of course, why canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Lois tell that Clark Kent is really Superman?\n\nGathering a veritable league of philosophers, Superman and Philosophy addresses all these questions and more. This book will thrill longtime and brand-new fans of Superman alike and will inspire new ways to think about the Man of Steel!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e931dce14115a2c0c968e9b55e5b05c3ebd2993","amp;dn":"Superman+and+Philosophy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e931dce14115a2c0c968e9b55e5b05c3ebd2993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,147,29,206,20,17,90,44,12,150,142,155,85,229,176,92,62,189,41,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
