E. Shilov. \n\n\n... we shall be dealing here with graphs of a different kind, with\ngraphs that must be plotted from given mathematical formulas. A need for such graphs often arises in various fields of knowledge. Thus, in analysing the theoretical course of some physical process, a scientist obtains a formula yielding some magnitude with which he is concerned, for example, the amount of product obtained relative to time. The graph plotted from this formula will provide a clear picture of the future process. Looking at it, the scientist may possibly introduce substantial changes into the scheme of his experiment in order to obtain better results.  \n\n     In this booklet we shall consider some simple methods of plotting graphs from given formulas.\n\n\n The book was translated the Russian by S. Sosinsky and was first published by Mir in 1978.\n\n  PDF | Cover | Bookmarks | OCR | 1.1 MB | 36 pp | 600 dpi\n\n \nReleased on TPB by mirtitles.org\n\nContents\n\nSections 1 to 3\nProblems\nSolutions\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:292705c0159cff91daf44e40d797c30f5729e309","amp;dn":"Shilov-Plotting-Graphs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"292705c0159cff91daf44e40d797c30f5729e309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,39,5,192,21,156,255,145,218,244,78,64,215,151,195,15,87,41,227,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
