Grossman, Ph.D., University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nNanotechnology, quantum computing, genetic engineering; these and other fascinating fields have the power to revolutionize almost every aspect of existence, including how you eat and drink, how you communicate, how you travel, how you learnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even how long you live.\n\n\nAnd in recent decades, these forces have evolved and developed at a lightning-fast pace. So fast, in fact, that the future of science and technology couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be any more exciting than it is now, as scientists are on the cusp of breakthroughs, including\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢new energy sources such as biofuels, solar photovoltaics, and nuclear fusion;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢smaller, more powerful computers that can tap into the secrets of artificial intelligence and operate advanced robotic systems;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢tools and equipment for making water safer to drink and food easier to grow, package, and preserve; and\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢new devices for speeding up the ways we travel from place to place and the ways we communicate and share information with one another.\nThese and other scientific breakthroughs of tomorrow will do more than enhance and improve everyday life. They also will help solve some of our worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most pressing crises and dilemmas, including food and water shortages, clean and reusable energy needs, detection and curing of life-threatening illnesses, and so much more. And while some of these promises are surrounded by hype and myth, the truths about them are more startlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and more importantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½than you ever imagined.\n\nExplore the many possibilities of what your future may look like with Understanding the Science for Tomorrow: Myth and Reality, a scientifically accurate and enlightening survey of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most advanced research in fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, and theoretical physics. These 24 lectures by research scientist and Professor Jeffrey C. Grossman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology delve into the genuine science of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and tomorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½hottest issues in an accessible manner that helps you grasp these sometimes esoteric topics. They are designed for anyone curious about the current state of science and technology and where it is likely to be heading in the near future.\n\n\n24 Lectures \n30 minutes / lecture\n1.\tChanging the Game\n2.\tMagnetismÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Science of Attractions\n3.\tTransportationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Science of How We Move\n4.\tComputersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Trillions of Bits per Second\n5.\tArtificial IntelligenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Thinking Machines\n6.\tRoboticsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Living with Machines\n7.\tMicroscopesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Power of Seeing It All\n8.\tNanotechnologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The New Science of Small\n9.\tNanotechnologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Changing Everything\n10.\tGenetic EngineeringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Life's Building Blocks\n11.\tSynthetic LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Making Life from Scratch\n12.\tThe BrainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Your Body's Supercomputer\n13.\tCancer and AgingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Can They Be Defeated?\n14.\tPowerful VirusesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Future Friend or Foe?\n15.\tFood or FamineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Science Holds the Key\n16.\tWaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Currency of the Next Century\n17.\tBiofuelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Fuel of the Future?\n18.\tSolar CellsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Electricity from the Sun\n19.\tBatteriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Storing Energy Chemically\n20.\tThe Hydrogen EconomyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Fact or Fiction?\n21.\tNuclear EnergyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Harnessing Star Power\n22.\tPredictionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½From Storms to Stocks\n23.\tCommunicationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Transcending Time and Space\n24.\tScience in the Future\n\n\nAbout Your Professor\n\nDr. Jeffrey C. Grossman is Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He earned his B.A. in Physics from Johns Hopkins University and his M.S. in Physics and his Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from the University of Illinois at UrbanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Champaign.\n\nBefore joining MIT, Professor Grossman founded and headed the Computational Nanoscience research group at the University of California, Berkeley, which focused on designing new materials for energy applications. At MIT, he heads a research group devoted to understanding, predicting, and designing novel materials with applications in energy conversion, energy storage, and thermal transport. As a Lawrence Fellow at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, he received the Physics Directorate Outstanding Science and Technology Achievement Award. He was also awarded a coveted Sloan Fellowship soon after joining MIT.\n\nProfessor GrossmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s current research centers on the development of new solar thermal fuels, the design of nanoscale technologies for sequencing DNA in hours, three-dimensional photovoltaic panels, new materials to convert waste heat into electricity, and more. He has also developed entirely new ways to encourage idea generation and creativity in interdisciplinary science, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspeedstorming,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a method of pair-wise idea generation that works similarly to a round-robin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspeed-datingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ technique.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd4d0f57039236ab10c0b2f228f007ef9bab1f2d","amp;dn":"Understanding+The+Science+For+Tomorrow+Lecture+By+Prof.+Jeffrey+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd4d0f57039236ab10c0b2f228f007ef9bab1f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,77,15,87,3,146,54,171,16,192,178,242,40,240,7,239,155,171,31,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
