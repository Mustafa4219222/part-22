This book provides a thorough introduction to the subject of solar physics, based on those spacecraft observations. The author introduces the solar corona, which has a temperature of several million degrees, and sets it in the context of basic plasma physics before moving on to discuss plasma instabilities and plasma heating processes.\n\nThe latest results on coronal heating and radiation, which are fundamental processes in all stars, are presented. Spectacular phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections are described in detail, together with their potential effects on the Earth. The author draws together observations made at many wavelengths from hard X-rays, soft X-rays, extreme UV and radio wavelengths.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad92a35879e7f69afc0388f79cbc60c26475f61b","amp;dn":"Physics+of+the+Solar+Corona","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad92a35879e7f69afc0388f79cbc60c26475f61b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,146,163,88,121,231,246,154,252,3,136,247,156,188,96,194,100,117,246,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
