Applied Calculus of Variations for Engineers addresses this very important mathematical area applicable to many engineering disciplines. Its unique, application-oriented approach sets it apart from the theoretical treatises of most texts. It is aimed at enhancing the engineerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s understanding of the topic as well as aiding in the application of the concepts in a variety of engineering disciplines.\n\nThe first part of the book presents the fundamental variational problem and its solution via the EulerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lagrange equation. It also discusses variational problems subject to constraints, the inverse problem of variational calculus, and the direct solution techniques of variational problems, such as the Ritz, Galerkin, and Kantorovich methods. With an emphasis on applications, the second part details the geodesic concept of differential geometry and its extensions to higher order spaces. It covers the variational origin of natural splines and the variational formulation of B-splines under various constraints. This section also focuses on analytic and computational mechanics, explaining classical mechanical problems and LagrangeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s equations of motion.
