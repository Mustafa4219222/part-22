Stone and Flinders\n\nRiga Film Studio, 1966\n\nDirector: Rolands KalniÃ…â€ Ã…Â¡\n\nLength: 80 minutesÃ¢â‚¬Â¨\nLanguage: Latvian\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Subtitles: English, Russian, Latvian\n\n20 years after WWII former friends RiÃ„ï¿½ards, JÃ„ï¿½nis and Antra, whose fates were irreversibly and tragically affected by the war, the need to choose sides, and by betrayal, meet again. With the present day interweaving with memories, their paths, experiences and convictions.\n\nThe only film made under occupation in Soviet Latvia that dared to speak of the Latvian legionnaires Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the soldiers who, in believing they were fighting for LatviaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s freedom, fought on the German side. For this reason the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creators felt opposition from the Soviet authorities from the beginning. In the spring of 1966, when Stone and Flinders was almost finished, the creative team wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t allowed to continue working. The Latvian Communist Party Central CommitteeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s First Secretary Augusts Voss forbade showing the film in Latvia, except for a few screening on the outskirts of Riga. The film was, however, shown in Russian theatres because I Remember Everything, Richard! (the other title of the film) was accepted by MoscowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s State Cinematography Committee. After many years of silence, the film entitled I Remember Everything, Richard!, was again shown in Latvia in 1986.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:485994bbb339953580c1da4f2905d0739c09ebc8","amp;dn":"Akmens+un+%26scaron%3B%C4%B7embas+%2F+Stone+and+Flinders+%281966%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"485994bbb339953580c1da4f2905d0739c09ebc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,89,148,187,179,57,149,53,128,193,218,79,41,5,208,115,156,9,235,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
