In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\nEpisode 3 : The Entebbe Raid\n\nThe skill and audacity of Israel's special forces was first shown in a daring raid on a vital Egyptian air-defence radar installation on Green Island. Seven years later, in July 1976, the world was amazed as a special forces team flew more than 2000 miles to rescue 94 Israeli citizens and the crew of an Air France Airbus, who were being held hostage in Entebbe, Uganda, after a hijacking.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afa90600c53a8d1ca8bac8480c9a548b7fa69d24","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.03of26.The.Entebbe.Raid.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afa90600c53a8d1ca8bac8480c9a548b7fa69d24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,169,6,0,197,58,141,28,168,186,200,72,12,154,84,139,127,166,157,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
