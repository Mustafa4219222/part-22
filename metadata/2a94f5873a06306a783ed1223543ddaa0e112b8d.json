Frank is a Manhattan medic, working graveyard in a two-man ambulance team. He&amp;#039;s burned out, exhausted, seeing ghosts, especially a young woman he failed to save six months&amp;#039; before, and no longer able to save people: he brings in the dead. We follow him for three nights, each with a different partner: Larry, who thinks about dinner, Marcus, who looks to Jesus, and Tom, who wallops people when work is slow. Frank befriends the daughter of a heart victim he brings in; she&amp;#039;s Mary, an ex-junkie, angry at her father but now hoping he&amp;#039;ll live. Frank tries to get fired, tries to quit, and keeps coming back, to work and to Mary, in need of his own rebirth.\n\nCAST\n\nNicolas Cage \t- Frank Pierce\nPatricia Arquette \t- Mary Burke\nJohn Goodman \t- Larry\nVing Rhames \t- Marcus\nTom Sizemore \t- Tom Wolls\nMarc Anthony \t- Noel\nMary Beth Hurt \t- Nurse Constance\nCliff Curtis \t- Cy Coates\nNestor Serrano \t- Dr. Hazmat\nAida Turturro \t- Nurse Crupp\nAfemo Omilami \t- Griss\nCynthia Roman \t- Rose\nCullen Oliver Johnson \t- Mr. Burke\nArthur Nascarella \t- Captain Barney","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a94f5873a06306a783ed1223543ddaa0e112b8d","amp;dn":"Bringing+out+the+dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a94f5873a06306a783ed1223543ddaa0e112b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,148,245,135,58,6,48,106,120,62,209,34,53,67,221,170,14,17,43,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
