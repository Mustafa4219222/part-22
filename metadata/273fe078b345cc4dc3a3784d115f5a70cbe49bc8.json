Yes, right through an open window, because Holy Flying Circus, about the furore of moral panic and hypocrisy that greeted the 1979 cinema release of Monty PythonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Life of Brian, usurps every bio-pic trope and convention.\n\nThus Holy Flying Circus is littered with dream sequences and wanders off down some fantastical little byways (a bit too often, if truth be told) as we build up to the infamous ambush, on the live TV chat show Friday Night... Saturday Morning, of John Cleese and Michael Palin by an epically supercilious Bishop of Southwark and religious commentator Malcolm Muggeridge. \n\nRoy Marsden is majestically effete and patronising as the bishop, Mervyn Stockwood, but the film belongs to Charles Edwards, who just IS Michael Palin, and Darren Boyd as John Cleese. \n\nOh, and Stephen Fry plays God. Of course. The whole thing is a mad mash-up of self-reference, cross-dressing, ribaldry and nonsense. I loved it. \nAbout this programme\n\nComedy drama, based on the controversy that surrounded Monty Python's Life of Brian on its release in 1979. As a campaign to ban the film gathered momentum, John Cleese and Michael Palin defended their work by participating in a live TV debate against Malcolm Muggeridge and the Bishop of Southwark - but the programme did not go according to plan. Darren Boyd and Charles Edwards star alongside Steve Punt, Rufus Jones, Tom Fisher, Phil Nichol and Stephen Fry.\n\n\nStephen Fry \t ... \tGod \nBelinda Stewart-Wilson \t ... \t Female Therapist \nDarren Boyd \t ... \tJohn Cleese \nMark Heap \t ... \t Andrew Thorogood \nMartin Marquez \t ... \t Richard Klein \nRoy Marsden \t ... \t Mervyn Stockwood \nAlex MacQueen \t ... \t 1937 BBC Head of Rude Words \nRupert Vansittart \t ... \t Bernard Barnard \nCharles Edwards \t ... \t Michael Palin \nTom Fisher \t ... \t Graham Chapman \nMichael Cochrane \t ... \t Malcolm Muggeridge \nSimon Greenall \t ... \t Barry Atkins \nSelina Griffiths \t ... \t 1937 BBC Secretary \nRufus Jones \t ... \t Terry Jones \nGeoffrey McGivern \t ... \t Petitioner\n\n\nHoly Flying Circus - (Monty Python) - TVrip - Xvid\n\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nBit rate                                 : 1 430 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 720 pixels\nHeight                                   : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 2\nCodec ID                                 : 50\nDuration                                 : 1h 29mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:273fe078b345cc4dc3a3784d115f5a70cbe49bc8","amp;dn":"Holy+Flying+Circus+-+%28Monty+Python%29+-+TVrip+-+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"273fe078b345cc4dc3a3784d115f5a70cbe49bc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,63,224,120,179,69,204,77,195,163,120,77,17,95,90,112,203,228,155,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
