Marcello Mastrioanni stars as Meursault, a man who feels utterly isolated from everyone and everything around him. This alienation results in sudden, inexplicable bursts of violence, culminating in murder. The subsequent trial of Meursault manages to convey the oppressive heat of its Algerian setting with director Luchino Visconti's usual veneer of elegant decadence. Though set in the 1930s, the sensibilities of the film were very much attuned to the 1960s: the problem was that Camus' sentiments had been adopted by so many other filmmakers of the period that The Stranger seemed rather commonplace. The film was originally released in Italy as Lo Straniero. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Stranger.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.08 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 1567 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 9.06 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 5\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 1498 Kbps\n      Width : 560 pixels\n      Height : 336 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.667\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.317\n      StreamSize : 1.03 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 38mn\n      Bit rate : 62 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video0 delay : 26ms\n      StreamSize : 43.8 MiB\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nIMDB: tt0062310\n\nTV Rip from German Television, posted at Karagarga by badge, who made a superb job in improving the quality of the rip.
