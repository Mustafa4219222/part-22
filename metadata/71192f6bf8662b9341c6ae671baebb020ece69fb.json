His dad's in the army and they've just moved to a town in New South Wales; his mom is pregnant; his older brother, Charlie, who's autistic, has his own adolescent sexual issues. Thomas finds Charlie an embarrassment in public, so when Thomas is attracted to Jackie, a girl in his swim class, Charlie presents any number of obstacles when she drops by their house, when the three of them go for a walk, and during a family birthday dinner. Can Thomas find a way to enter the world of teen romance and still be his brother's keeper, or is Charlie's disability going to prove more than Thomas can handle? Director: Elissa Down. Stars: Rhys Wakefield, Luke Ford, Toni Collette, Erik Thomson, Gemma Ward.\n\nEnglish subtitle file included in torrent.\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71192f6bf8662b9341c6ae671baebb020ece69fb","amp;dn":"AUSTRALIAN+MOVIE+-++The+Black+Balloon+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71192f6bf8662b9341c6ae671baebb020ece69fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,25,47,107,248,102,43,147,65,198,174,103,27,174,187,2,14,206,105,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
