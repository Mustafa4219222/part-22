A particular characteristic of this book is that it presents with considerable breadth and rigor both vibrations and controls. Many contemporary texts combine both of these topics in a single, one term course. This text supports the more favorable circumstance where the material is covered in a one year sequence contains enough material for a two semester sequence, but it can also be used in a single semester course combining two topics. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mechanical Systems: A Unified Approach to Vibrations and ControlsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ presents a common notation and approach to these closely related areas. Examples from the both vibrations and controls components are integrated throughout this text","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb30e8a3c4a94629167568e73ecc184085a3c522","amp;dn":"Mechanical+Systems%3A+A+Unified+Approach+to+Vibrations+and+Control","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb30e8a3c4a94629167568e73ecc184085a3c522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,48,232,163,196,169,70,41,22,117,104,231,62,204,24,64,133,163,197,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
