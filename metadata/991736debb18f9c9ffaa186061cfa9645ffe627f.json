Released 1988 on the English 'Black Lion' Label.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nTeamed up with pianist Kenny Drew, bassist Niels Pedersen and drummer Albert &quot;Tootie&quot; Heath for a club date at Copenhagen's Montmartre in 1967 (reissued on CD by Black Lion), the great tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin really stretches out on four numbers: &quot;The Man I Love,&quot; &quot;Hush-A-Bye,&quot; &quot;Blues for Harvey&quot; and a memorable version of &quot;The Masquerade Is Over.&quot; Griffin shows why he was early on billed as &quot;the world's fastest tenor&quot; although he also displays warmth on &quot;Sophisticated Lady.&quot; A fine example of Griffin's underrated talents.\n\n01.
