The set, recorded in 2009 at New York's Rubin Museum of Art,\r\ndemonstrates how a hard existence reinforced by the act of producing earnest\r\nmusic can shape a grounded being into a positive force for a listening\r\nhumanity; resentment and bad vibes are entirely absent from the scene. About\r\nBang, who left us in 2011, Parker writes: &quot;When the music came around it\r\ngrabbed him and he was majestic&quot;. The same applies to the bassist over the\r\ncourse of these five tracks, and we are the ones rejoicing for this superb\r\ncombination of fervent talents.\r\n\r\nThroughout the concert the mood is, so to speak, celebratory without\r\nreligiousness. The long title track sounds like a vehement joint invocation,\r\nprior to becoming a model of individual skill. The way Bang and Parker\r\nextrapolate scything upper partials, profound melodies and built-in rhythms\r\nwhile surfing the crest of quarter-tone waves is impressive, to say the\r\nleast. In &quot;Eternal Planet&quot;, an homage to Leroy Jenkins, they add the oil of\r\ndissonant spirit to already firing improvisational cylinders; a diminutive\r\nstring combo with a light-heavyweight's clout. Both in those contexts and in\r\ncalmer sections â€” such as the beautiful &quot;Sky Song&quot;, characterized by Parker's\r\nuse of the shakuhachi â€” one is pervaded by a much desired feeling of\r\npeacefulness, notwithstanding a few acoustic discrepancies which, at any rate,\r\nwon't bother a trained ear. The album exudes an inner confidence soundtracked\r\nby a pair of arcos refraining from any sort of mannerism in favor of a somewhat\r\nfibrous quietude.\r\n\r\nQuoting again Parker's heartfelt liners, &quot;Billy showed me how to laugh, and\r\nthrough that laughter to see life as the most serious thing there could\r\nbe&quot;. Accordingly, these sounds will embrace those still willing to open\r\nthemselves up to the warmth that comes with the unworried acceptance of life's\r\nsevere teachings.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Martin Schray \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/06/billy-bang-william-parker-medicine.html\r\n\r\nBy Derek Taylor\r\n\r\nBy Jason Bivins \nhttp://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD50/PoD50MoreMoments2.html\r\n\r\nBy Mike Shanley \nhttp://jazztimes.com/articles/160328-medicine-buddha-billy-bang-william-parker\r\n\r\nDa Aldo Del Noce (it) \nhttp://www.jazzconvention.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2400:billy-bang-a-william-parker-medicine-buddha&amp;catid=2:recensioni&amp;Itemid=11\r\n\r\nPar Guillaume Belhomme (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcb5e41c29ceca116e83ba5da479c1c2e07286e3","amp;dn":"Billy+Bang%2C+William+Parker+-+Medicine+Buddha+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcb5e41c29ceca116e83ba5da479c1c2e07286e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,181,228,28,41,206,202,17,110,131,186,93,164,121,193,194,224,114,134,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
