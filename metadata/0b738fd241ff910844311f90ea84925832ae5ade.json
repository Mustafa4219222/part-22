Wood, Jr. in 1958, and released in 1959. The film stars Gregory Walcott, Mona McKinnon, Tor Johnson and Maila &quot;Vampira&quot; Nurmi. The film also claims to posthumously star Bela Lugosi through use of archive footage and a brief scene of the actor shot by Wood just before Lugosi&amp;#039;s death in 1956, although Lugosi&amp;#039;s character is primarily portrayed by chiropractor Tom Mason.\n\nThe plot of the film is focused on a race of extraterrestrial beings who are seeking to stop humans from creating a doomsday weapon that would destroy the universe. In the course of doing so, the aliens implement &quot;Plan 9&quot;, a scheme to resurrect Earth&amp;#039;s dead as zombies to get the planet&amp;#039;s attention, causing chaos.\n\nBy merit of its writing, unconvincing special effects, and multiple production errors visible in the final version of the film, Plan 9 from Outer Space is sometimes regarded as a leading candidate for the title of &quot;worst movie ever made&quot;. It has also earned Edward D. Wood, Jr. a posthumous Golden Turkey Award as the worst director ever.\n\nIMDB: 3.5/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0052077/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0052077/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b738fd241ff910844311f90ea84925832ae5ade","amp;dn":"Plan+9+From+Outer+Space+%281959%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b738fd241ff910844311f90ea84925832ae5ade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,115,143,210,65,255,145,8,68,49,31,144,234,132,146,88,50,174,90,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
