P. Lovecraft short story of the same name, produced by Sean Branney and Andrew Leman and distributed by the HP Lovecraft Historical Society. It is the first film adaptation of the famous Lovecraft story, and uses Mythoscope, a blend of vintage and modern filming techniques intended to produce the look of a 1920s-era film.\n\n.: Plot :.\n\nIn the story, a dying professor leaves his great-nephew a collection of documents pertaining to the Cthulhu Cult. The nephew begins to learn why the study of the cult so fascinated his grandfather. Bit-by-bit he begins piecing together the dread implications of his grandfather's inquiries, and soon he takes on investigating the Cthulhu cult as a crusade of his own. As he pieces together the dreadful and disturbing reality of the situation, his own sanity begins to crumble. In the end, he passes the torch to his psychiatrist, who in turn hears Cthulhu's call.\n\n.: Cover :.\n\n[img]http://img373.imageshack.us/img373/2113/cocdvdfrontet0.gif[/img]\n\n.: Credits :.\n\nRelease date October 1, 2005\nRunning time 47 min.\nCountry USAGenre Horror,Thriller\nDirected by Andrew Leman\nProduced by Sean Branney, Andrew Leman\nWritten by Sean Branney\nMusic by Troy Sterling Nies, Ben Holbrook, Nicholas Pavkovic, Chad Fifer\nEditing by David Robertson\nDistributed by H.
