I live in the Pendleton as surely as I live everywhere. I am the Pendleton's history and its destiny. The building is my place of conception, my monument, my killing ground. . . .  The Pendleton stands on the summit of Shadow Hill at the highest point of an old heartland city, a Gilded Age palace built in the late 1800s as a tycoon's dream home. Almost from the beginning, its grandeur has been scarred by episodes of  madness, suicide, mass murder, and whispers of things far worse. But since its rechristening in the 1970s as a luxury apartment building, the Pendleton has been at peace. For its fortunate residentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½among them a successful songwriter and her young son, a disgraced ex-senator, a widowed attorney, and a driven money managerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the Pendleton's magnificent quarters are a sanctuary, its dark past all but forgotten. But now inexplicable shadows caper across walls, security cameras relay impossible images, phantom voices mutter in strange tongues, not-quite-human figures lurk in the basement, elevators plunge  into unknown depths. With each passing hour, a terrifying certainty grows: Whatever drove the Pendleton's past occupants to their unspeakable fates is at work again. Soon, all those within its boundaries will be engulfed by a dark tide from which few have escaped. Dean Koontz transcends all expectations as he takes readers on a gripping journey to a place where nightmare visions become realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and where a group of singular individuals hold the key to humanity's destiny. Welcome to 77 Shadow Street.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1be095f0a95816acf1321a411c2c74d35e39658e","amp;dn":"Dean+Koontz-77+Shadow+Street%2CEpub%2CMobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1be095f0a95816acf1321a411c2c74d35e39658e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,224,149,240,169,88,22,172,241,50,26,65,28,44,116,211,94,57,101,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
