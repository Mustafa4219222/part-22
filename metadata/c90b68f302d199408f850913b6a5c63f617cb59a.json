This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThis is a Michael Jackson themed countdown. Wierd Al parodies &quot;Beat It&quot; with his song at number 14, Michael sings back-up on Rockwell's song at number 2, and the king of pop is on the chart himself at number 15.\n\nCasey tells how the band Blondie got its name, and how Tracey Ullman got a recording contract.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;How many top 40 hits have named dogs in their titles?&quot; Casey says twelve but doesn't stop there.\n\nCasey lists three of the most prominent New Zelanders to make the American charts.\n\nLW#1: Jump - Van Halen\n40:    One In A Million - The Romantics\n39:    To All The Girls I've Loved Before - Julio Iglesias And Willie Nelson\n38:    A Fine Fine Day - Tony Carey            \n37:    The Kid's American - Matthew Wilder\n36:    Head Over Heels - The Go-Go's\n35:    The Authority Song - John Cougar Mellancamp\n34:    Red Red Wine - Ub40\n33:    Nobody Told Me - John Lennon\n32:    Leave It - Tes\n31:    Let's Stay Together - Tina Turner\n30:    Tonight - Kool &amp; The Gang\n29:    Don't Answer Me - The Alan Parsons Project\n28:    You Might Think - The Cars\nLDD: You've Got A Friend - Carole King\n27:    New Song - Howard Jones        \n26:    Love Somebody- Rick Springfield\n25:    They Don't Know - Tracey Ullman\n24:    Come Back And Stay - Paul Young\n23:    Runner - Manfred Mann's Earth Band\n22:    Give It Up - K.C.\n21:    Girls - Dwight Twilley\n20:    Back Where You Belong - .38 Special\n19:    Radio Ga-Ga - Queen\n18:    New Moon On Monday - Duran Duran\n17:    The Language Of Love - Dan Fogelberg\n16:    Got A Hold On Me - Christine McVie\n15:    Thriller - Michael Jackson\n14:    Eat It - &quot;Weird&quot; Al Yankovic\n13:    Hello - Lionel Richie\n12:    Hold Me Now - Thompson Twins\n11:    99 Luftballons - Nena\n10:    Miss Me Blind - Culture Club\n9:    Adult Education - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n8:    Automatic - The Pointer Sisters\n7:    Against All Odds - Phil Collins\nLDD: So Far Away - Carole King\n6:    I Want A New Drug - Huey Lewis &amp; The News\n5:    Girls Just Want To Have Fun - Cyndi Lauper\n4:    Here Comes The Rain Again - Eurythmics\n3:    Jump - Van Halen\n2:    Somebody's Watching Me - Rockwell\n1:    Footloose - Kenny Loggins\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c90b68f302d199408f850913b6a5c63f617cb59a","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1984_March_31st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c90b68f302d199408f850913b6a5c63f617cb59a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,11,104,243,2,209,153,64,143,133,9,19,182,165,198,63,97,124,181,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
