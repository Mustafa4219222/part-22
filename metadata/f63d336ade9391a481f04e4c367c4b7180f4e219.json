The group was originally called the Sherabons and was formed in Hackney during November of 1963 by Martin Murray. His day job was managing a hair salon, and when he formed the band, he brought along his assistant, Anne Margot Lantree, who was nicknamed &quot;Honey&quot; and used that on-stage -- she played drums and, with her good looks, was a double attention-getter. Her brother John joined on bass, and Alan Ward played lead guitar. And for a lead vocalist, they had Dennis D'Ell (born Denis Dalziel). Their original name was the Sherabons (some sources list it as the Sheratons) -- something Murray remembers seeing on the side of a van -- and they got a three-times weekly gig at a pub called the Mild May Tavern, on Balls Pond Road in London's East End, where they were lucky enough to be spotted by Alan Blaikley, who was attracted by the crowds of teenagers they drew.  ....\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:a9fqxqw5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:a9fqxqw5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nDespite downwardly spiraling commercial fortunes, the Honeycombs recorded a second album in 1965 that featured as many intriguing production flourishes and oddball British pop songs as their first effort. No hits were included on this LP -- and be warned that the version of their minor hit single &quot;I Can't Stop&quot; (probably their best song) featured here is an inferior, drastically slower remake. This album also includes a mighty obscure ballad by Ray Davies, &quot;Emptiness,&quot; that was never recorded by the Kinks (or any other artist but the Honeycombs, for that matter). It's not much of a song, but it's a find for Kinks fanatics. The record's highlights are the sparkling guitars of &quot;Love in Tokyo&quot; and the soulful ballad &quot;Something I Got to Tell You&quot; (featuring drummer Honey Lantree on vocals), which sounds like an honest-to-god hit-that-never-was. The CD reissue of the album adds six non-LP cuts from 1965-1966 singles. The best of these are the tense, overwrought ballad &quot;Should a Man Cry?&quot; and the up-tempo &quot;Can't Get Through to You,&quot; on which producer Joe Meek took his vari-speed vocals and neurotic rhythms to their farthest extremes.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gifixq85ld0e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gifixq85ld0e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA page with no reviews and none for sale: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MBENHS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000MBENHS&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
