He is probably best remembered for his works for children and for his poem &quot;The Listeners&quot;. He also wrote some subtle psychological horror stories, amongst them &quot;Seaton's Aunt&quot; and &quot;Out of the Deep&quot;. His 1921 novel Memoirs of a Midget won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction and his post-war Collected Stories for Children won the 1947 Carnegie Medal for British children's books.\n\nDe la Mare described two distinct &quot;types&quot; of imagination Ã¢â‚¬â€œ although &quot;aspects&quot; might be a better term: the childlike and the boylike. It was at the border between the two that Shakespeare, Dante, and the rest of the great poets lay. De la Mare was also a significant writer of ghost stories. John Clute comments that &quot;in his long career, de la Mare seems to have published about 100 stories, of which about eighty-five have been collected. At least forty of these have supernatural content&quot;.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Walter de la Mare, Short Stories 1895Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1926 (1996) -\n                                                    - -&gt; (ed.
