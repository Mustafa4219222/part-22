This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nA listener asks this question. &quot;During the rock era, which number one song holds the record for staying in the top 10 the least number of weeks?&quot; Casey says this song was by a former Beatle.\n\nAnother listener wants to know if there ever been a year in the rock era when only groups and no solo singers occupied the number one spot. Casey says no but tells how it almost happened in 1965.\n\nYet another listener asks, &quot;What's the greatest number of weeks it has taken for any song to climb to its highest position on the chart?&quot; The song in question took 32 weeks to get to number 16 according to Casey.\n\nThere is a song in the countdown by a band who once wore disguises and then tried to pretend they were their own opening act. Casey tells how they were almost booed off the stage.\n\n40:    Hit The Road Jack - The Stampeders\n39:    Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win) - Fleetwood Mac\n38:    Misty Blue - Dorothy Moore            \n37:    Tryin' To Get The Feeling Again - Barry Manilow\n36:    We Can't Hide It Anymore - Larry Sexton\n35:    Strange Magic - Electric Light Orchestra\n34:    Sara Smile - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n33:    Fopp - The Ohio Players\nEXTRA: All I Have To Do Is Dream - The Everly Brothers\n32:    You'll Lose A Good Thing - Freddy Fender\n31:    Lorelei - Styx\n30:    Love Fire - Jigsaw\n29:    Looking For A Space - John Denver\n28:    Only Love Is Real - Carole King\n27:    Livin' For The Weekend - The O'Jays        \n26:    Shannon - Henry Gross\n25:    Tangerine - Salsoul Orchestra\n24:    Take It To The Limit - The Eagles\n23:    I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do - ABBA\n22:    Love Machine Pt. 1 - The Miracles\n21:    Action Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sweet\n20:    Welcome Back - John Sebastian\n19:    All By Myself - Eric Carmen\n18:    Fooled Around And Fell In Love - Elvin Bishop\n17:    Deep Purple - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n16:    Money Honey - The Bay City Rollers\n15:    There's A Kind Of Hush (All Over The World) - The Carpenters\n14:    December 1963 (Oh What A Night) - The Four Seasons\n13:    Sweet Thing - Rufus featuring Chaka Khan\n12:    Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen\n11:    Show Me The Way - Peter Frampton\n10:    Golden Years - David Bowie\n9:    Sweet Love - The Commodores\n8:    Only Sixteen - Dr. Hook\n7:    Boogie Fever - The Sylvers\n6:    Dream On - Aerosmith\n5:    Right Back Where We Started From - Maxine Nightingale\n4:    Let Your Love Flow - The Bellamy Brothers\n3:    Lonely Night (Angel Face) - The Captain &amp; Tennille\n2:    Dream Weaver - Gary Wright\n1:    Disco Lady - Johnnie Taylor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb07cdb971609cd0f20b2831144073f6b96cba0","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1976_April_10th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb07cdb971609cd0f20b2831144073f6b96cba0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,176,124,219,151,22,9,205,15,32,178,131,17,68,7,63,107,150,203,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
