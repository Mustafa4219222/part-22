His first novel, The Stolen Child, was a national bestseller, and his second novel, Angels of Destruction, was hailed as â€œa magical tale of love and redemption that is as wonderfully written as it is captivatingâ€ (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette). Centuries of June is a bold departure, a work of dazzling breadth and technical virtuosity.\r\n\r\nSet in the bathroom of an old house just before dawn on a night in June, Centuries of June is a black comedy about a man who is attempting to tell the story of how he ended up on the floor with a hole in his head. But he keeps getting interrupted by a series of suspectsâ€”eight women lying in the bedroom just down the hall. Each woman tells a story drawn from five centuries of American myth and legend in a wild medley of styles and voices.\r\n\r\nCenturies of June is a romp through history, a madcap murder mystery, an existential ghost story, and a stunning tour de force at once ingenious, sexy, inspiring, and ultimately deeply moving","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88e7aa029ea72c1d5344d4699fa0c1b0656c2c17","amp;dn":"Centuries+of+June+-+Keith+Donohue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88e7aa029ea72c1d5344d4699fa0c1b0656c2c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,231,170,2,158,167,44,29,83,68,212,105,159,160,193,176,101,108,44,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
