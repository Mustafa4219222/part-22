Have fun guys, and tell me if it works. I haven't tried\ncuz I don't wanna :P\n \n \n \n \nCHANGELOG: \n\nMulti-player: we are working on an improved multi-player code where all known issues should get resolved (reduced lag, predictions, variable time step, etc.). We are aware that some of you are experiencing various issues in multiplayer. We expect that this new code will be ready in a few weeks.\n\nFeatures\n- added cargo ships - auto-piloted vessels (miners, freighters and military) that carry ore, ingots, constructions components and other materials from sector to sector. They can be looted but beware, they often contain booby traps!\n- changed the priority of how devices consume power (solar panels first, then nuclear reactors)\n- increased the max speed of astronaut character to 111.5 m/s  - this speed is higher than the max speed of ships (players are now able to catch up ships flying at max speed)\n- silver refinement is 4x faster (used in reactor and medical components)\n- added support for surround sound systems \n\nFixes\n- fixed small thrust damaging large heavy armor\n- fixed sound when exiting world\n- fixed landing gear weird sound\n- fixed crash in Character movement\n- fixed issue when placing a block next to a door\n- fixed issue when the player can join incompatible version using invite\n- fixed death after load when the player is in narrow corridors\n- fixed broken mirroring of solar panels\n- fixed wrong collision model of ship drill after deformations\n- fixed painting without preview\n- replaced some non-localizable texts with localizable\n- fixed crash caused by particle effect\n- fixed landing gear green light after landing gear was turned off\n- fixed toolbar issues and slot activation/deactivation\n- fixed player death in cockpit hit by warhead\n- fixed crash in Gravity Generator\n- fixed rare infinite loading caused by refinery\n- fixed issues with large weapons on toolbar\n- fixed stuck character after leaving cockpit [version 01.023.013]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Extract\n2. Install ALL redists you need\n3. Open the Bin or Bin64 folder (Bin is for 32bit, Bin64 is for 64bit)\n4. Launch the game. \n \nYou can also play online with people if you follow those other instructions lol.\nHave fun?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f784b9cf57323c2abe5b092b010d572559d769f2","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.023.013+%5Bx32%2Bx64%5D+w+ack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f784b9cf57323c2abe5b092b010d572559d769f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,132,185,207,87,50,60,42,190,91,9,43,1,13,87,37,89,215,105,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
