I won't go into specifics, as a Wikipedia search will turn up all you need to know about them.\n\nI got this d/l from another site, that i can't remember the address of, and can't be asked to look for again, and seeing as it wasn't on here, I've decided to upload it here. Aren't I nice?\n\nIts perfect quality, at 320 bit-rate, if the other torrent description is to be believed anyways. I've listened to it myself a couple times over, and I can say that no matter what the bit-rate is, its flawless, and I personally love the album.\n\nSo, enjoy guys, and remember to seed and buy if you like/can afford to!\n\nP.S: I have a YouTube channel, where I'm doing Minecraft videos, but if you wanna check me out, pop PhoenixPyres into Youtube's search engine :)\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ded0379835af02e88967ef28aca22fa30ae0857c","amp;dn":"Yashin+We+Created+A+Monster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ded0379835af02e88967ef28aca22fa30ae0857c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,208,55,152,53,175,2,232,137,103,239,40,172,162,47,163,10,224,133,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
