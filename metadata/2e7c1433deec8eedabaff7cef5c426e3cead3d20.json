The main characters do not leave their property and are not disturbed by Cromartie. Instead, the episode introduces the back story to Derek Reese&amp;#039;s life through a series of flashbacks to the future dystopia from which he came.\n\nThe episode begins immediately where Queen&amp;#039;s Gambit left off, with Charley Dixon commencing CPR on Derek, who had been shot by a T-888 Terminator, later identified as Vick. After a lengthy fight for Derek&amp;#039;s life, Charley&amp;#039;s efforts succeed in stabilizing him.\n\nDerek&amp;#039;s first flashback reveals the future world is a nightmare landscape, strewn with rubble and ruin, where people hide from the machines in underground tunnels and only come to the surface to engage in combat. Kyle Reese and Derek are shown as soldiers fighting Skynet alongside two other soldiers named Sayles and Billy Wisher (an allusion to William Wisher, co-writer of Terminator 2). When they come to the surface, they are separated from Kyle and are captured along with their assault team by a Terminator. They are taken to a resistance holding ground where one of the more primitive rubber-skinned T-600 Terminators fuses a barcode on each fighter&amp;#039;s arm.[1] While in the holding ground, after being tortured by a terminator, Wisher confesses to Derek that his real name is Andy Goode and admits his role in creating Skynet. He begs Derek to forgive him. Derek apparently undergoes the same torture after being taken to the basement, where music is inexplicably playing (FrÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©ric Chopin&amp;#039;s Nocturne in C-sharp minor (Lento con gran espressione), Op. posth.). The actual torture is not shown, but after being taken back upstairs Derek appears traumatized and semi-conscious. Sometime thereafter, the prisoners awake to find they have been left alone, a hatchet left for them to break free of their chains. When they get back to their base, they find the Terminators have located and attacked it. When Derek searches for survivors, he cannot find his brother Kyle (since at this point Kyle went back in time to protect Sarah Connor from the T-800 Model 101 Terminator as seen in the original film). Weeks later, at a resistance base, Derek recognizes Cameron and nearly shoots her. One of the other resistance fighters tries to calm him down by saying she was reprogrammed and is &quot;one of ours&quot;. Sometime later, a reprogrammed Terminator malfunctions and starts killing people in the base. Cameron destroys it, telling Derek that sometimes reprogrammed Terminators inexplicably &quot;go bad&quot;. A few months later, Derek finds out about the newly-developed time-portal, and agrees to go to the year 2007 with other resistance fighters (the same fighters found dead in the apartment in the episode Gnothi Seauton). While explaining the mission to the other soldiers, he sees Wisher/Andy Goode and they exchange nods, implying that Derek intends to kill him in 2007 despite being ordered only to set up a safehouse and await further instruction.\n\nThe remainder of the episode takes place in the present-day storyline (that is, 2007). Charley hesitantly gets reacquainted with Sarah and John. Sarah finally explains to Charley about the Terminators. Charley is bemused by the implausible-sounding narrative of Sarah&amp;#039;s life, but seems willing to believe her. Charley also observes Cameron disposing of the T-888 she terminated in the previous episode. She strips away its flesh revealing its metal endoskeleton, which Charley inadvertently stumbles upon in the garage. By this point he has proof that Terminators exist; he also acknowledges that Cameron is a machine, calling her a &quot;very scary robot.&quot; Cameron then destroys the remains of the Terminator by burning it with thermite in an improvised cinderblock furnace. This destroys all traces of the machine&amp;#039;s existence, except for its dismembered left hand, which Agent Ellison recovered in the previous episode. Sometime later, tension develops between Cameron and Sarah, as Sarah intuits that Cameron might kill Charley because he has learned too much. Cameron submits that she will not, and promises to recover the T-888&amp;#039;s missing hand. Curiously, after promising to destroy every last bolt of the T-888, Cameron is shown to have kept the T-888&amp;#039;s chip she had extracted from its skull in the previous episode.\n\nLater, Charley and Sarah have an emotional reconciliation, but don&amp;#039;t seem to rekindle their prior relationship. Charley apprises her of Agent Robert Kester, whom Charley doesn&amp;#039;t know is really Cromartie posing as an FBI agent.\n\nThe episode also reveals that John&amp;#039;s lineage?specifically his relation to his father, Kyle Reese?is a closely guarded secret. Neither Derek (Kyle&amp;#039;s brother) nor Cameron is aware of this fact. John desires to learn more about his father from Derek. Sarah, however, forbids John from revealing his lineage to his uncle since she distrusts him, calling him &quot;a stranger&quot; and noting that future John has not told him about the secret. Derek later recovers from his injuries, and John tells him that Kyle had come back in time to protect him and Sarah and died doing so. Just as he is about to reveal that Kyle is his father, Sarah enters the room, so instead John calls Kyle a hero.\n\nIn the last scene of the episode the viewer sees a flashback to Andy&amp;#039;s hotel room, while Andy is still alive. Derek appears, shoots him through the head, and flees.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e7c1433deec8eedabaff7cef5c426e3cead3d20","amp;dn":"Terminator+-+The+Sarah+Connor+Chronicles+S01E06+-+Dungeons+%26+Dra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e7c1433deec8eedabaff7cef5c426e3cead3d20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,124,20,51,222,236,142,237,171,175,247,206,245,196,38,227,206,173,61,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
