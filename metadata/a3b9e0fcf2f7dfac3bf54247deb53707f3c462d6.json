Excellent, Missler tells it all on what Christmas really is.\n\n\nDescription\n\nDr. Chuck Missler, a widely recognized Biblical authority, updates his classic study of Christmas for 2007. He explores the background, and myths, surrounding our favorite holiday.\n\n   * What really happened in Bethlehem two thousand years ago?\n   * Who were the &quot;Magi?&quot;\n   * Why a virgin birth?\n   * What does a Christmas Tree have to do with it?\n\nEach year at Christmas we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.\n\nAfter the New Year, we struggle to remember to add a year as we date our checks, which should remind us that the entire Western World reckons its calendar from the birth of the One who changed the world more than any other before or since.\n\nIt is disturbing to discover that much of what we have been taught about the Christmas season seems to be more tradition than truth. Santa Claus isn't the only myth or legend that has arisen out of this season.\n\nOn what &quot;loophole&quot; does the Messianic hope rest? Who were the Maji? And why a &quot;virgin birth?&quot; What does a Christmas Tree have to do with it?\n\nThis study contains 2 hours of teachings\n\nThis is dedicated to my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nThe Entire Collection of POtHS can be found here: \n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\n\n\n           \n      :thankyou:    :thankyou:     Thank You JESUS     ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3b9e0fcf2f7dfac3bf54247deb53707f3c462d6","amp;dn":"POtHS+-+Christmas+Special+2012+-+The+Christmas+Story+-+Chuck+Mis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3b9e0fcf2f7dfac3bf54247deb53707f3c462d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,185,224,252,242,247,223,172,59,245,66,71,222,181,55,7,243,196,98,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
