Baba ZulaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music is basically an amalgamation of recorded natural sounds with both traditional and modern acoustic and electronic musical instruments, a culmination of disparate electronic effects. Starting out by improvisations, later fixed into musical elements which make up their music such as theme, tune, style and sound, reached through recordings and rehearsals, the group has carried this method of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdefined improvisationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ into concerts, movies, theatrical plays, use of video, slides and films, prepared by the additional members who have joined forces with the core group in its live performances.\n\nBaba Zula is a Turkish musical group, founded in Istanbul in 1996, featuring founding members Levent Akman Murat Ertel as well as CoÃƒâ€¦Ã…Â¸ar KamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â± who replaced original member Emre Onel in 2005. BaBa Zula added live drawing artist Ceren Oykut into the mix in 2004. Her presence onstage has added an important visual aspect to BaBa ZulaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s live performances. Akman, Ertel, and Onel originally formed Baba Zula as a side project of now disbanded Anatolian rock group Zen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41e85fff654cff0131bda43ed563e6ff67150be9","amp;dn":"Baba+Zula+%28Album+pack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41e85fff654cff0131bda43ed563e6ff67150be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,232,95,255,101,76,255,1,49,189,164,62,213,99,230,255,103,21,11,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
