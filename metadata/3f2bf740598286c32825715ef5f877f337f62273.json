The three members were barely past their teenage years when they became a musical sensation during 1972, scoring #1 hits and winning a Grammy for best new musical artist. Their recording success was almost entirely throughout the 1970s; some of the band's best known songs are &quot;A Horse with No Name&quot;, &quot;Sister Golden Hair&quot; (both of which reached #1), &quot;Ventura Highway&quot;, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, &quot;Daisy Jane&quot;, and &quot;Lonely People&quot;.\n\nSome of the band's singles and albums were successful commercially, and they attracted the services of The Beatles' producer, George Martin, for a series of seven albums. The band suffered a heavy blow when Dan Peek quit the group in 1977, right at its apex, but Beckley and Bunnell returned America to the top 10 as a duo with &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; in 1982. Continuing to tour, America maintains a loyal fan base and performs over 100 shows per year. On January 16, 2007, America released Here &amp; Now, the band's first major label studio album in over twenty years.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img123.imageshack.us/img123/5251/americathebestof1996fronf0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img123.imageshack.us/img123/5251/americathebestof1996fronf0.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1-You can do magic\n2-The border\n3-The last unicorn\n4-All my life\n5-Survival\n6-Tall treasures\n7-One morning\n8-Honey\n9-My dear\n10-One in a million\n11-Right before your eyes\n12-We got all night\n13-Lady with a bluebird\n14-Only game in town\n15-Ventura highway\n16-Daisy jane\n17-I need you\n18-Tin man\n19-Sister golden hair\n20-Horse with no name","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f2bf740598286c32825715ef5f877f337f62273","amp;dn":"America+-+The+Best+Of+%5BMp3+192+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f2bf740598286c32825715ef5f877f337f62273","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,43,247,64,89,130,134,195,40,37,113,94,245,248,119,243,55,246,34,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
