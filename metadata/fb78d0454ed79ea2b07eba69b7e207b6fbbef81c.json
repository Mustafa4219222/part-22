Unfortunately Top Gun's combat is a bit formulaic. You'll draw in close, do some quick-timey stick presses to either evade and circle your opponent or to stay on their tail and then shoot missles up their backside. You'll rinse and repeat this same strategy against 95 percent of the enemies in the game, which can get a bit tiresome. If you're looking for intense combat, this game definitely has it, as long as you can look past the repetition. Like the combat, levels get a touch repetitive; there are only so many MiGs you can shoot down and allies you can save before you realize you're just doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nThe game heavily utilizes a rather nasty grit filter over its graphics. Everything has this rough, dirty haze to it that detracts from the overall look. I think it's used to distract a bit from the game's bland environment textures, but I found it rather ugly. It's a shame too because some of the graphics are rather nice, including some great water texture and lighting.\n\nTop Gun: Hard Lock pays plenty of tribute to its movie namesake, with character cameos, recognizable theme music and plenty of direct references to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“danger zone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It also includes plenty of groan-inducing banter between pilots, a few uncomfortable boner jokes and even a bit of 1980s action movie chauvinism Ã¢â‚¬â€œ oh, and a requisite Ã¢â‚¬Å“do a barrel rollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reference. I appreciated the mix of light-hearted banter and overwrought dramatic posturing that the writers brought to the game - it never swings into pure drama or pure comedy territory.\n\nInstall:\n1.mount\n2.install\n3.copy the crack to the game folder\n4. play!\n\nIf anyone has got problem with the rld.dll, need enable this in the antivirus!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb78d0454ed79ea2b07eba69b7e207b6fbbef81c","amp;dn":"Top+Gun+Hard+Lock+-+RELOADED+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb78d0454ed79ea2b07eba69b7e207b6fbbef81c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,120,208,69,78,215,158,162,176,126,186,105,183,226,7,182,251,190,248,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
