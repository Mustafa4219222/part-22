If not, how and why has 2012 millenarianism gained such popular appeal? In this deeply knowledgeable book, two leading historians of the Maya answer these questions in a succinct, readable, and accessible style. Matthew Restall and Amara Solari introduce, explain, and ultimately demystify the 2012 phenomenon. Firmly grounded in historical fact, while also being revelatory and myth-busting, this fascinating book will be essential reading as the countdown to December 21, 2012, begins. \n\nFebruary 2011\nPublisher: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.\nFormat: Hardcover 147pp \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa7fa3ee2a98b396e5ba482bee7e52ed77c71209","amp;dn":"2012+and+The+End+of+The+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa7fa3ee2a98b396e5ba482bee7e52ed77c71209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,127,163,238,42,152,179,150,229,186,72,43,238,126,82,237,119,199,18,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
