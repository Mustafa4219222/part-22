However, there is no single term to replace it that covers all African Pygmies.[5] Many so called pygmies prefer instead to be referred to by the name of their various ethnic groups, or names for various interrelated groups such as the Aka (Mbenga), Baka, Mbuti, and Twa.[6] The term Bayaka, the plural form of the Aka/Yaka, is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. Likewise, the Kongo word Bambenga is used in Congo. \n\nWikipedia \n\n\nHiQuality: 320Kbps + detailed booklet (byAmbroseBierce)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25bb4cd438bdec17af9da62696cd0eb7673505d1","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Pygmees+Aka+-+Musiques+et+chants+polyphoniques+de+la+sy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25bb4cd438bdec17af9da62696cd0eb7673505d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,187,76,212,56,189,236,23,175,157,166,38,150,205,14,183,103,53,5,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
