The Ship [4:30]\n\nA cappella trios might not be the thing of chart success, but when they write and perform songs as wonderfully as Coope, Boyes &amp; Simpson, listening is a joy. Their take on everything is utterly political, from &quot;Farewell to England,&quot; which casts a very open eye on the state of the country, to the traditional &quot;Rufford Park Poachers,&quot; with its excoriation of the 19th century class system. They've long focused on World War I, and that interest is here in &quot;Shuffling Jack&quot; and the medley of &quot;Little Man You've Had a Busy Day/Standing in Line,&quot; both of which rail against the class system that sent so many to their deaths. But politics aren't their sole agenda. There's also romance, both in the title track and the hurt of &quot;Weekend Girl.&quot; The real joy of their sound is that it's so full you don't even notice the lack of instruments. When they open up, as on the verses of &quot;Spinning in the Sky,&quot; the sound's almost orchestral. And though they might be categorized as folk, they often write what are really intelligent pop songs. Indeed, the melody of &quot;Since the Exodus Began&quot; closely resembles Jethro Tull's &quot;We Used to Know.&quot; Listen, and you won't even realize it's all done with just voices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab19d50432f18a59f48343e33cadb9e67c628aff","amp;dn":"Coope+Boyes+%26amp%3B+Simpson+-+Falling+Slowly+%5B1996%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab19d50432f18a59f48343e33cadb9e67c628aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,25,213,4,50,241,138,89,244,131,67,227,60,173,185,230,124,98,138,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
