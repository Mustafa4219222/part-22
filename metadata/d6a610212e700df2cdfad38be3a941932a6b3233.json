According to Kurtz, it is because there is within the human species a deeply rooted tendency toward magical thinkingÃ¢â‚¬â€the Ã¢â‚¬Å“transcendental temptationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€which undermines critical judgment and paves the way for willful beliefs.\n\nKurtz explores in detail the three major monotheistic religionsÃ¢â‚¬â€Judaism, Christianity, and IslamÃ¢â‚¬â€finding striking psychological and sociological parallels between these religions, the spiritualism of the nineteenth century, and the paranormal belief systems of today. This acclaimed and controversial book includes sections on mysticism, belief in the afterlife, the existence of God, reincarnation, astrology, and ufology. Kurtz concludes by explaining and advocating rational skepticism as an antidote to belief in the transcendental.\n\n604 pages\nPublisher: Prometheus Books\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0879756454\nISBN-13: 978-0879756451","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a610212e700df2cdfad38be3a941932a6b3233","amp;dn":"The+Transcendental+Temptation+%281986%29+by+Paul+Kurtz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a610212e700df2cdfad38be3a941932a6b3233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,166,16,33,46,112,13,242,205,250,211,139,227,169,65,147,42,107,50,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
