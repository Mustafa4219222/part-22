The rapid development of control technology has an impact on all areas of the control discipline. New theory, new controllers, actuators, sensors, new industrial processes, computer methods, new applications, new philosophies and, new challenges. Much of this development work resides in industrial reports, feasibility study papers, and the reports of advanced collaborative projects. The series offers an opportunity for researchers to present an extended exposition of such new work in all aspects of industrial control for wider and rapid dissemination","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c773991d289810681819dc3c3e692cfd161ba3f8","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Industrial+Control+%5BUpdated+at+2016.01.01%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c773991d289810681819dc3c3e692cfd161ba3f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,115,153,29,40,152,16,104,24,25,220,60,62,105,44,253,22,27,163,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
