The TV show was better, but it only lasted the 1959 to 1960 season. Created by Blake Edwards, who was also still producing &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; \nat the time, Edwards again wisely hired Henry Mancini to compose the music.\n\nMr. Lucky was played by lesser-known actor John Vivyan.\n\nAlthough these episode files are titled, there are no titles on film\nso instead I'll just list the guest stars I'm familiar with in each episode.\n\n1. Nehemiah Persoff and Ziva Rodann\n\n2. Pippa Scott, Norman Alden, Madge Blake, and Conrad Nagel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81129a9a06818b5ca41eaa1ee9a712c8778a403d","amp;dn":"MR.+LUCKY+--+first+2+episodes+of+the+TV+action+series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81129a9a06818b5ca41eaa1ee9a712c8778a403d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,18,154,154,6,129,139,92,164,30,170,30,233,167,18,200,119,138,64,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
