Bateman, who celebrated his 80th birthday in 2010, continues to be a prolific artist and active public speaker. All of the art in this book is recent and has never been published in book form before. Bateman s works have been the focus of sell-out shows in the US and UK, including an exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. A true naturalist, Bateman is utterly committed to promoting the protection of wildlife and their environs. Every detail of his art and writings support and inspire this goal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:268636a047c3c62c7ca0f8f7d6a6771567508af7","amp;dn":"Bateman+-+New+Works+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"268636a047c3c62c7ca0f8f7d6a6771567508af7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,134,54,160,71,195,198,44,124,160,248,247,214,166,119,21,103,80,138,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
