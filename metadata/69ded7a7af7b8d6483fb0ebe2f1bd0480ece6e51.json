Certain demons carry the title of prince, which is always the demon in charge of a principality. A principality is a territory, an area, a place or a group that may range in size from as large as a nation to as small as a person. When satan assigns a prince a task, the prince is given the authority to act in the name of satan and use whatever means necessary or available to him to accomplish his task.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ded7a7af7b8d6483fb0ebe2f1bd0480ece6e51","amp;dn":"divine+revelation+audio+and+eBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ded7a7af7b8d6483fb0ebe2f1bd0480ece6e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,222,215,167,175,123,141,100,131,251,14,190,47,27,208,72,14,206,110,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
