With delectable recipes for each season, this luscious abundant take on food will delight women everywhere.\n\nSophie Dahl has been both round as a Rubens and as sylphy as a sapling, through trial, error and an episode in India which needn't be discussed in detail with anyone.\n\nShe lived out the latter part of her adolescence in public, and so her puppy fat, which should have been a tender family joke, became fuel for national debate. At the time this was crippling to her, and one of the reasons she moved to another country. Flirting with every food fad from Atkins to raw food, she has had both misadventures and victories in her quest to have a sound healthy relationship with food.\n\nNow in her twenty-ninth year it is suddenly simpler: Sophie cooks and eats, and does both with gusto. It can be lonely and confusing navigating food, particularly with the standards of beauty and weight that are thrust upon us by advertisers. Sophie aims to debunk some of the horrible punishing diet myths, and replace them with compassionate common sense, anecdotal stories and a lashing of healthy recipes. This is a book that doesn't encourage guilt or monastic deprivation, but celebrates the joy in food and eating.\n\nOriginal, funny, quirky with a bit of whimsy, this glorious ebook is full of wonderful anecdotes and delicious recipes and scattered with SophieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own lovely Matisse-like line drawings that slope off the page.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile size: epub 2,187 KB, mobi 2,235 KB\nPublisher: HarperCollins\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B003V1WVZW\n\n\n\n\nTitle:\n\nPLAYING WITH THE GROWN UPS by Sophia Dahl\n\n\nDescription:\n\nKitty loves living at the isolated Hay House with her doting grandparents, but it cannot provide the adventure and excitement that her restless, bohemian mother Marina craves. When a guru sees Marina's future in New York, Kitty is torn from her home and bounced from place to placeÃ¢â‚¬â€first a colorless boarding school, then an American ashram, and finally back to an unfamiliar England. But soon, no god, man, or martini can staunch Marina's hunger for a happiness that proves all too elusive. And Kitty, turning fifteen, must choose: whether to play dangerous games with the grown-ups or put herself first.\n\nWith this witty and poignant debut novel, Sophie Dahl ably carries on the literary legacy of her grandfather, the beloved children's book author Roald Dahl.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nFile Size: epub 556 KB, mobi 349 KB\nPublisher: Bloomsbury Publishing    \nLanguage: English\nISBN -13: 9781408806708    \n\n\n\nNote: Have tried out all four files to test their chapter links and website links.
