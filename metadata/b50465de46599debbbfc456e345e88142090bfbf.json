What an unexpected occurrence.\nIf my sarcasm-soaked opening sentences didn&amp;#039;t quite get the message across, Testament&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;The Legacy&amp;#039; shares the same crown as so, \nso many 1980s Thrash debuts as being the strongest piece of work its creating band ever released. I really don&amp;#039;t know what it was. \nMusicianship improved but the fire in the blood and the creative juices of so many bands seemed to lull as time went on. However, \nnothing can take away from the fact that &amp;#039;The Legacy&amp;#039; is an essential example 80s Thrash.\nNo time for acoustic intros or interludes here readers, it&amp;#039;s straight into the Thrash attack. &amp;#039;Over The Wall&amp;#039; kicks things off with an \nimpressive bang. Galloping drums, heavy guitars, aggressive vocals and beefy bass are present from the outset and provide the \nbackbone of one seriously solid track. 2:32 into the track it&amp;#039;s time for guitars to take center stage in a big way. Awesome dueling solos \nensue, elevating the track from good to something truly special.\nIt quickly becomes apparent songs are quite formulaic (Thrash, Thrash, Thrash, Solo, Thrash/Close), but with hints of middle eastern \ninfluence, prehistoric subtleties and a group of extremely talented musicians, what is lacking in pioneering originality is amicably \ncompensated for in pure quality. &amp;#039;Burnt Offerings&amp;#039; is another of the side A highlights, showing diversity within its genre-defined \nconstraints. Sweet riffs and more appetising solos combined with the aggressive vocal delivery of Chuck Billy (whose predecessor on \nthe pre-Testament Legacy demos was none other than Steve Souza who went on to join Exodus) to create a track that owners of &amp;#039;The \nLegacy&amp;#039; CD pressing consistently find it hard to get past.\nTwo other noteworthy tracks are &amp;#039;Alone In The Dark&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;First Strike Is Deadly&amp;#039; both of whom feature infectious riffs and very \nmemorably vocals performances prior to the closer, &amp;#039;Apocolyptic City&amp;#039; which also happens to be the longest of the ennead of featured \ntracks.\nTestament&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;The Legacy&amp;#039; is an essential part of every Thrash collection. &amp;#039;Nuff said.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50465de46599debbbfc456e345e88142090bfbf","amp;dn":"Testament+-+The+Legacy+%281987%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5Bcolombo-br.org%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50465de46599debbbfc456e345e88142090bfbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,4,101,222,70,89,157,235,187,252,69,110,52,94,136,20,32,144,191,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
