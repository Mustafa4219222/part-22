'This Is How the Wind Shifts' is arguably Silverstein's most ambitious, mature, and progressive album to date. It is yet another concept album, similar to 2009's 'A Shipwreck In the Sand' featuring fourteen ambitious tracks that clearly demonstrate the band's growth and progression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb486d887757f9093207048b4610dfa19ba9ad8","amp;dn":"Silverstein+-+This+Is+How+the+Wind+Shifts+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb486d887757f9093207048b4610dfa19ba9ad8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,180,134,216,135,117,127,144,147,32,112,72,180,97,13,250,25,186,154,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
