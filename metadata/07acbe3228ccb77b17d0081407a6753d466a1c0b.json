Clark and Daniela De Gregorio. He is from Liverpool who met Daniela (born in Spoleto) and lived happily ever after in Italy.\n\nBooks:\nCritique of Criminal Reasoning (#1): It has been years since Immanuel Kant's landmark philosophical work, Critique of Pure Reason, brought him fame throughout Europe and made him KÃƒÂ¶nigsberg's best-known citizen. Now, rumors have begun to surface of a new work by this aging but still acute mind. Yet unlike his earlier work, this book will not examine the mind of the average man, but the mind of the serial killer.\n\nHanno Stiffeniis, a young magistrate, has been called to KÃƒÂ¶nigsberg to assist in the investigation of an enigmatic string of murders. Is it part of a plot formed by Napoleon's spies to undermine the Prussian king or the work of a solitary, unknown killer? The case would seem unsolvable, were it not for the assistance and unmatched intellect of his mentor, Immanuel Kant. Together Stiffeniis and the elderly, eccentric philosopher must track down the killer who has the city of KÃƒÂ¶nigsberg by the throat.\n\nDays of Atonement (#2): It is 1807 and NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s army has swept over Prussia, leaving in its wake a conquered land occupied by the French. Local magistrate Hanno Stiffeniis has retreated to his home in the countryside in the hopes that he can keep himself away from the scrutiny of the occupying forces. But when Serge Lavedrine, ParisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famed criminologist, requires his services, Stiffeniis has little choice but to accept.\n\nThree children have been found massacred in their beds. Their mother has disappeared without a trace. Terrified by the gruesome murders, the local townspeople have become convinced that the crimes are the work of the local Jewish population. The ghetto has been closed off, but the crowds gathered in the streets are desperate for justice of any kind. The French authorities want nothing more than a quick resolution and an end to the hysteria that has gripped the town.\n\nA Visible Darkness (#3): Prussia has been overrun by NapoleonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces, and the EmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s troops have discovered a new source of funds there: enough amber to finance FranceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wars. But their plans stall when the girls who collect the stones begin to disappear, only to be found gruesomely disfigured by an unknown killer. The French call upon Prussian investigator Hanno Stiffeniis, who must seek out the culprit knowing hat his own success may doom his countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future. Dark, intelligent, and vividly written, A Visible Darkness continues a masterful series of historical mysteries that portray a past torn between nationalism and humanism, superstition and science.\n\nUnholy Awakening (#4): A womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body has been found at the bottom of a well. The death wounds are startling: two small, round punctures to the jugular vein. . . . \n\nVampire fever is spreading throughout the countryside, and suspicions soon fall on the recently arrived Emma Rimmele. Investigator Hanno Stiffeniis must do everything he can to find the true culprit before the mobÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hysteria reaches its breaking point and turns violent.\n\nSet in a nineteenth-century world where people truly believed in vampires, Unholy Awakening pits rational, scientific detection against unhindered, violent superstition.\n\nFull Retail ePub and Mobi calibre ready.
