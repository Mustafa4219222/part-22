Squash Bowels play sick gore/pornogrind with a nice flair. Vocals are gutfuckingly low (and sometimes kind of screamy), and the guitars follow their queue. That isn&amp;#039;t to say that there are no audible riffs, though. I can definitely hear some nice riffs at times. This band sounds like Malignancy, a bit, drum-wise and sometimes vocal-wise. Though Malignancy are more technical, this album reaches its high points with pure grind. Drums are very often blastbeats, and they sound top-notch and don&amp;#039;t really drag down the album like blastbeats sometimes do. Also, a thumbs up on fills. Some slow parts are also inserted, which I found to be rather satisfying, as they show off nice drumming and guitars. The best tracks on the album are &quot;Strong Will,&quot; &quot;Life Business,&quot; &quot;Handsome Scum,&quot; and &quot;The Mass Sickening.&quot; Brutal death fanatics and grind fans alike will find something to headbang to in this album, and I guarantee it.\n\n\n\nTracklist - \n1 Screams Saints Pig Head (2:46) \n2 Breaking Those Who Suspend To Talk...
