We aim to have a realistic system, while still being fun to play.\n\nThink driving a train is too easy and boring? We dare you to try it with Train Driver!\n\nWait for the departure signal, close the doors and off you go. Just pay attention to the signs. And don't worry, if you know nothing about driving a train, our tutorial will guide you via an introductory ride. After this ride, the tracks are randomly generated, so you get a different ride every time you play.\n\nIn the future, we aim to improve and optimize graphics, and also introduce localised routes with country-specific signals, tracks and trains (with strong emphasis on realism), including High Speed Rail. For now, we have the Polish signals and default train is based on clunky old Polish EN57 EMU. We will soon be adding New Zealand local signals and trains.\n\nWARNING: Despite the description, this app is currently incompatible with Android 2.2 and below. We hope to fix compatibility with 2.2 with the next update.\n\nWhat's New:\n\n-curved tracks - not just a straight line anymore!\n-factory, church and grain silo\n-minor adjustments to scenery\nIn next release, we will bring you railroad switches and proper, multi track stations!\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.marcinw.TrainDriver&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.marcinw.TrainDriver&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af769db54112332fb346a6cf89dd218b00c77b0c","amp;dn":"Train+Driver+-+Train+Simulator+v1.1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af769db54112332fb346a6cf89dd218b00c77b0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,118,157,181,65,18,51,47,179,70,166,207,137,221,33,139,0,199,123,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
