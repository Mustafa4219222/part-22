When it's his turn to solo on this opening number, Coryell turns up the heat, sounding like a cross between Jimi Hendrix and Sonny Sharrock. (Coryell played with Sharrock on Herbie Mann's Memphis Underground.) &quot;The Great Escape&quot; finds Coryell cooking over a bass and percussion groove, with Marcus on tenor sax. &quot;Call to the Higher Consciousness&quot; is a side-long 20-minute jam in which all the players take a ride, with Marcus once again cooking on the soprano sax. Roy Haynes is superb throughout, working in tandem with the percussionists to keep the music moving. This recording is a noteworthy example of the possibilities inherent in the early days of fusion, blending the electrifying energy of rock with the improvisational excitement of jazz.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2a5088aeb1fcdb818e1e0b98e533c0eedcee0d5","amp;dn":"Larry+Coryell+-+Barefoot+Boy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2a5088aeb1fcdb818e1e0b98e533c0eedcee0d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,165,8,138,235,31,205,184,24,225,224,185,142,83,60,14,237,206,224,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
