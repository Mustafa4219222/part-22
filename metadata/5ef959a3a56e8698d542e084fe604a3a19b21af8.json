It also contained French subtitles only.\n\nWe bring it to you in DivX at full 720 X 576 resolution at 900k video bitrate\nincluded is a full 192k audio track in the original language only.\nSubtitles were converted from the disc - which included only the French\nand we found English sub on the net which were the right fit luckily \nFirst line in subtitles begins at 1min 10 seconds in case you are looking for matching subs - the ones that start at 1:14 or 1:22 did not fit I'm sad to say.\n\nWe cannot allow ourselves the possibility that any in our midst envision\nwhat is shown in this movie as something we want to become equal to in any\nnotions of propriety whatsoever. The &quot;monkey dance&quot; done by Steve Balmer at Microsoft on one occasion is shown equally by a neanderthal genius in this\nmovie who takes it upon himself to swing a belt buckle at at boy carrying some\ntea to see if this would entertain the visiting gal (from Australia?) no thanks!\n(to this brand of entertainment genius and social modelling insanity!)
