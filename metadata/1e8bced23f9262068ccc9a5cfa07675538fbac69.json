She and coauthor Skolnik, a nutritionist, met while filming a food-centric segment for Good Morning America, and have paired up to recommend a lifestyle change that emphasizes fueling up with a larger meal early in the day and, in the later hours, replenishing as needed via snacks and smaller meals.\n\nWhile much of the duo's advice is not new (whole foods are preferable to processed ones, eat more vegetables, avoid sugary sodas), it is intriguing. Food lists, portion information and recipes help with planning aheadÃ¢â‚¬â€preparing meals ahead of time is also key, the authors say. A section on setting realistic goals aims to help readers manage their expectations, and recommendations for using a &quot;hunger scale&quot; encourage mindfulness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8bced23f9262068ccc9a5cfa07675538fbac69","amp;dn":"The+Reverse+Diet%3A+Lose+20%2C+50%2C+100+Pounds+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8bced23f9262068ccc9a5cfa07675538fbac69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,139,206,210,63,146,98,6,140,204,154,92,250,7,103,85,56,251,172,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
