Larry runs the farm with his father while Elaine, originally from Coolock, commutes daily to work at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. The couple long for a warm, spacious and welcoming farmhouse but the bungalow is dark, poorly laid out and totally out of sync with its glorious rural surroundings.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 08-Feb-2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81ee957cc22c43509c19604dd83e2815b74918fd","amp;dn":"Room.to.Improve.S08E03.HDTV.x264-SI.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81ee957cc22c43509c19604dd83e2815b74918fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,238,149,124,194,44,67,80,156,25,96,77,216,62,40,21,183,73,24,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
