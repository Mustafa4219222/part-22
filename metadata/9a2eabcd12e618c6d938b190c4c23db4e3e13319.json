The lead artist Nick Tipping and lead programmer Mark Featherstone on Gun Metal went on to form Moonpod.\nGun Metal allows players to pilot a futuristic mech which can transform into a plane. The game is based around a war (sometime in the future) on a planet called Helios, where humans have settled. Enemy spacecraft have followed them from Earth and are attempting to exterminate the colony. Project Gunmetal is a massive operation which oversaw the creation of a supremely powerful war machine. In its primary form, a walking &quot;humanoid&quot; mech many dozens of feet high, it possesses a range of 12 weapons and an electronic shield. At the push of a button, it transforms into an advanced fighter jet reminiscent of a modern fighter jet. It also possesses 12 weapons, ranging from napalm, pulse cannons, harpoons and rockets.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a2eabcd12e618c6d938b190c4c23db4e3e13319","amp;dn":"Gun+Metal+%28CD+Rip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a2eabcd12e618c6d938b190c4c23db4e3e13319","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,46,171,205,18,230,24,198,217,56,177,144,196,194,61,180,227,225,51,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
