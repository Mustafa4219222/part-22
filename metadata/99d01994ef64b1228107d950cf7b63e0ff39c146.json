Shiva then declares a holy war on those who seek to continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. \nThe battles rages on and Shiva travels to the land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99d01994ef64b1228107d950cf7b63e0ff39c146","amp;dn":"The+Oath+Of+the+Vayuputra+complete....Llama_king","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99d01994ef64b1228107d950cf7b63e0ff39c146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,208,25,148,239,100,177,34,129,7,217,80,207,123,99,224,255,57,193,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
