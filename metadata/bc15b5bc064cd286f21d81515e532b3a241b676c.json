Humans alone lack the power of speech. Two years ago, Dr. Zaius banished all humans from Ape City, launching a campaign of eradication. But one among them was taught to communicate with his hands. Now the human rebellion has begun. They don't need to speak to find their voice... Collecting the critically acclaimed series, find out what happens 18 years before the arrival of Colonel George Taylor from the original 1968 Planet of the Apes movie! Written by fan-favorites Corinna Bechko and Gabriel Hardman and drawn by red hot artist Marc Laming (The Rinse).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc15b5bc064cd286f21d81515e532b3a241b676c","amp;dn":"Exile_on_the_Planet_of_the_Apes_Vol_1_TPB_%282012%29_%28Digital%29_%28Dogm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc15b5bc064cd286f21d81515e532b3a241b676c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,21,181,188,6,76,210,134,242,29,129,81,94,83,43,58,36,27,103,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
