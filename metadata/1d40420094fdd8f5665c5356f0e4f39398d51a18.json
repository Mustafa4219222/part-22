There, conglomerate TarrenTech provides the high school teams with every advantage, including a high-tech sports clinic. Dr. Martin Ames beefs up the brawny, aggressive teenagers, and it&amp;#039;s to him that newcomer Sharon Tanner goes for answers when her gentle son Mark turns into a belligerent jock overnight. This slick, high-concept thriller, which might have been titled Stepford High , won&amp;#039;t surprise anyone, but it should please the author&amp;#039;s fans as it continues Saul&amp;#039;s focus on children as the vehicles and victims of unnatural forces.\n\nBitrate....64kbps\nLength.....02:50:29\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d40420094fdd8f5665c5356f0e4f39398d51a18","amp;dn":"Creature+-+John+Saul+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d40420094fdd8f5665c5356f0e4f39398d51a18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,64,66,0,148,253,216,245,102,92,83,86,240,228,243,147,152,213,26,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
