R Stevens isn't afraid for his characters to deliver dialogue from atop the potty or behind a post- coital cigarette. The unreal veneer of pixels allows him to slip a plethora of icky moments under our radar.\nOf course, you catch him at it, and he plays dumb, delivering a string of nice-as-pie comics about kittens. Or a sequence of comics built around almost pointillist wordplay.\nHe's wily.\nThis collection showcases his wiliest moves to date.&quot;\n\nJohn Allison\nAuthor of scarygoround.com Manchester, England\nJune 2003\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dieselsweeties.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dieselsweeties.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328888ccd74440b7b5ede604344dcee7e0088b1c","amp;dn":"Diesel+Sweeties+Pocket+Sweeties+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328888ccd74440b7b5ede604344dcee7e0088b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,136,136,204,215,68,64,183,181,237,230,4,52,77,206,231,224,8,139,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
