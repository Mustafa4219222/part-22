What Becomes of the Broken hearted [ Mix with Spoken Intro]--------------JIMMY RUFFIN (born 7 May 1939 in Collinsville, Mississippi) is an American soul singer, and older brother of David Ruffin, one of the lead singers for The Temptations. Jimmy himself was offered to sing with the Temptations, but politely declined in favor of David.\n\nHis 1966 hit &quot;What Becomes of the Brokenhearted&quot; was a major success, and his most well-remembered song. The intended follow-up, however, &quot;East Side West Side&quot; was only released in Australia due to an argument between Motown head Berry Gordy. The song was written by Ron Welser, and Flamingos member Terry Johnson. He also released, with his brother David, a popular cover version of &quot;Stand By Me&quot; (by Ben E. King), taken from the Ruffin Brothers album, I Am My Brother's Keeper.\n\nRuffin's other hits include &quot;I've Passed This Way Before&quot;, &quot;Gonna Give Her All The Love I've Got&quot;, &quot;Don't You Miss Me A Little Bit Baby&quot;, &quot;I'll Say Forever My Love&quot;, &quot;It's Wonderful To Be Loved By You&quot; and &quot;Tell Me What You Want&quot;.\n\nIn 1980 he collaborated with the Bee Gees musician, Robin Gibb, who produced his album Sunrise. From it came the single which would be his last Top 10 UK and U.S. hit, &quot;Hold On To My Love&quot;. In 1986 he collaborated with the British pop group, Heaven 17, singing &quot;A Foolish Thing To Do&quot;, and &quot;My Sensitivity&quot;, on a 12&quot; EP record.\n\nIn the 1980s, Ruffin moved to England, where he has his own talk show.
