Kelly (who, in his day, filled it for \nLuther Vandross, who filled it for Barry White). \n\nThough he lacks the vocal heat and instant magnetism of all those artists, there's a lot to like on this \ndebut, the over-the-top attempts to insinuate himself into the fantasies of the opposite sex especially. \n\nThe song titles&quot;shameless to a one&quot;say it all: &quot;Lights Down Low,&quot; &quot;Come Touch Me,&quot; &quot;One Girl To Love.&quot; \nSubject matter aside, Valentino busts out a swoony vocal gift that, if not the stuff of legends, should \nserve him well on the R&amp;B charts: shades of Stevie Wonder swim through &quot;I'll Forgive You,&quot; a Winans \ninfluence wanders in on &quot;Love Dream,&quot; and an old-school Coolio-style rap raises an edge around \n&quot;Give Me A Chance.&quot; &quot;Gangsta Love,&quot; with its &quot;coke-bottle body/likes to get naughty&quot; lyric, is a \nslimly veiled ode to freakiness, and it flicks up the fun factor. \n \t\n\nRecording information:\n\nRelease Date \tApr 26, 2005\nStudio/Live \tStudio\nProducer \tGary &quot;Gizzy&quot; Smith\n\nPersonnel:\n\nBobby Valentino - vocals\nTim Kelley - various instruments, guitar, keyboards, bass guitar, drum programming\nBob Robinson - 12-string guitar, piano, keyboards\nGary Smith - drum programming\nKevin &quot;KD&quot; Davis\n\nLinage: CD &gt; EAC &gt; Flac\nIncludes: Vorbis Tags &amp; Front.jpg .Log &amp; .Cue NFO, PLS, M3U\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
