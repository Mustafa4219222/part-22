Blair, his former girlfriend, is married to Trent, an influential manager whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a bisexual philanderer, and their Beverly Hills parties attract various levels of fame, fortune and power. Then thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ClayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s childhood friend Julian, a recovering addict, and their old dealer, Rip, face-lifted beyond recognition and seemingly even more sinister than in his notorious past.\n\nBut ClayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own demons emerge once he meets a gorgeous young actress determined to win a role in his movie. And when his life careens completely out of control, he has no choice but to plumb the darkest recesses of his character and come to terms with his proclivity for betrayal.\n\nA genuine literary event.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf0cd1e52b055ce423e313ecb0b051ff5298ae51","amp;dn":"Imperial+Bedrooms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf0cd1e52b055ce423e313ecb0b051ff5298ae51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,12,209,229,43,5,92,228,35,227,19,236,176,176,81,255,82,152,174,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
