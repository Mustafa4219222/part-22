Why does Air Force One always appear with its left side facing the public and how much does the president know about activating the on-board flares to repel missiles? What other secrets are available to the president, and what information is so highly classified that even the commander in chief's Top Secret-3 security clearance is not enough to gain access?\n\n\n\nHistory uncovers the fascinating truths behind some of the most confidential secrets in American history in THE PRESIDENTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S BOOK OF SECRETS. Interviews with former intelligence operatives, renowned historians and archivists show how classified information is treated in the highest circles of political power, how itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preserved throughout history, and who ensures continuity when a new leader is elected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Jonathan Adams\n===========================\n\nProduced by: Frankie Glass\n==========================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    The President's Book Of Secrets\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:27:55\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2212 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English\nFile Size:...........:    1.35 GB\nFPS..................:    23.976000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1769369/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1769369/&lt;/a&gt;\n  \n  \n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included.\n==================================\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b010e1ae380262b395206beed991b599358d6115","amp;dn":"The+Presidents+Book+Of+Secrets-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b010e1ae380262b395206beed991b599358d6115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,16,225,174,56,2,98,179,149,32,107,238,217,145,181,153,53,141,97,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
