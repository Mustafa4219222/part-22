It was the start of a revolution in air travel, military and civilian. During the 1940s Britain's first-ever jet aircraft, the world's first jet fighter in squadron service and the first jet to hold the world air-speed record were all designed, built and flown in the Gloucester and Cheltenham area. The story of Frank Whittle's invention and dogged development of the jet engine is well known. But the account of how his invention was put into the air has never been fully told. This book tells the story of how the men and women of north Gloucestershire made Whittle's engine fly.\n\nAbout the Author\nTim Kershaw is a former chairman of the Jet Age Museum (the museum is currently without a permanent home), but is based in Gloucester. He worked in technical publicity for GEC, Johnson Mathey and Plessy, moved to corporate PR in the city and then decided on a radical career change to become a professional architectural model maker. He lives near Tewkesbury. \n\nPrint Length: 176 pages\nPublisher: The History Press (March 31, 2013)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00BS02YUU\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jet-Pioneers-Gloster-Birth-ebook/dp/B00BS02YUU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373042355&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jet+pioneers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jet-Pioneers-Gloster-Birth-ebook/dp/B00BS02YUU/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373042355&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=jet+pioneers&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6a08c93f2022a377d03b242cfb35060c0fa7877","amp;dn":"Jet+Pioneers%3A+Gloster+and+the+Birth+of+the+Jet+Age+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6a08c93f2022a377d03b242cfb35060c0fa7877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,160,140,147,242,2,42,55,125,3,178,66,207,179,80,96,192,250,120,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
