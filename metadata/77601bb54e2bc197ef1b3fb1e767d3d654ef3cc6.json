To do so, Ezio will have to recover stolen paintings and a pair of new locations designed exclusively for the new DLC. \n\nIn addition to the single-player mission, 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' will expand the multiplayer experience as well. Included in 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' is an all-new map, Alhambra, set in Spain's Albaicin of Granada. The map includes indoor and outdoor areas to provide ample opportunity to blend in before striking. \n\nFour new characters will be available to play as in 'The Da Vinci Disappearance?' including Dama Rossa, the Knight, the Marquis and the Pariah. With those characters you'll be able to partake in two new gameplay modes: Escort, in which two teams of four must protect their VIP target while striking at the others'; and Assassinate, which is a straightforward Deathmatch mode featuring 6-8 players and a 10-minute time limit.\n\nInstallation:\nCopy downloaded file with replacement to:\n\nFor XP: C:\\Documents and Settings\\(User Name)\\Application Data\\Ubisoft\\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\\Saves\\\n\nFor Vista/7: C:\\Users\\(User Name)\\Saved Games\\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\\Saves\\ or C:\\Users\\Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\\Saves\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77601bb54e2bc197ef1b3fb1e767d3d654ef3cc6","amp;dn":"Assassin%5C%27s+Creed+Brotherhood+%5C%27The+Da+Vinci+Disappearance%5C%27+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77601bb54e2bc197ef1b3fb1e767d3d654ef3cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,96,27,181,78,43,193,151,239,27,63,177,231,103,211,214,84,239,60,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
