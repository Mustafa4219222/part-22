Its most prominent founding member was Juan Pablo Calvo, who started taking piano lessons at age 8 but quickly quit in favor of the guitar due to the strong influence of the grunge revolution. Soon enough he discovered heavy metal and progressive rock and, after finishing high school, he dropped the guitar only to get back to the keys. After playing in several bands and learning how to write and arrange songs, he decided to form a new band, TIME&amp;#039;S FORGOTTEN. He got in touch with other highly-skilled, progressive-metal-loving musicians who, together, became Costa Rica&amp;#039;s premiere progressive act.\n\nThe band released their first full-length, &quot;A Relative Moment of Peace&quot;, in 2006, to moderate, surprising-for-an-unknown-band, commercial success. Soon after the outfit played its first live shows to great acclaim.\n\nThe band continued to impress the audiences and by 2007 they were already invited to perform abroad, at the highly-respected progressive-rock festival &quot;Baja Prog Festival&quot; in Mexicali, Mexico, a feat never before accomplished by a Costa Rican band, a country with a very small, but thriving, musical market.\n\nTIME&amp;#039;S FORGOTTEN music can be described as progressive-metal with a lot of different influences. The DREAM THEATER influence is clear, as is the more atmospheric sounds of bands like PORCUPINE TREE, at times the fierce attacks of OPETH...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b943122930a1f1474ac7cfe9628f5d0b0d8c20","amp;dn":"Time%5C%27s+Forgotten+-+A+Relative+Moment+Of+Peace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b943122930a1f1474ac7cfe9628f5d0b0d8c20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,185,67,18,41,48,161,241,71,74,199,207,233,98,143,93,11,13,140,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
