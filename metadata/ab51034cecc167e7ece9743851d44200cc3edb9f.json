Featuring new reinterpretations of songs by NIN, Bauhaus, and Peter Murphy's solo work plus tracks by TV on the Radio, Pere Ubu, Iggy Pop, the Normal, and Joy Division. Performed live with a small audience for each track, the songs reveal an intimacy and feel of two artists playing songs to reveal their influences and their acknowledgment of each one. Though so far, it's an incomplete collection, it remains to be one of the legendary and inspiring work that Trent Reznor and Peter Murphy has done in their great, respective careers. \n\nRadio Session # 1-Atlanta, GA 99x 6/7/06 \n\nRadio Show 1 - Atlanta GA\nRadio Show 1 - Atlanta GA/01 Head Like a Hole (originally by Nine Inch Nails).mp3\nRadio Show 1 - Atlanta GA/02 The Sanity Assassin (originally by Bauhaus).mp3\nRadio Show 1 - Atlanta GA/03 Hurt (originally by Nine Inch Nails).mp3\n\n\nRadio Session # 2-Washington D.C.
