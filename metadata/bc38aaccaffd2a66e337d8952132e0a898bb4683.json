The instrumentals, obviously, aren't affected by this malady; they're typically rousing. But whenever Cotton opens his mouth, he sounds as though he's been gargling Drano.\n\n***** I completely agree with the above review. Luckily there are many fine instrumental tracks and a Dr. John guest vocal but this one may be for James Cotton collectors only. *****\n\n\n1. Mississippi Freight Train\n2.
