Once a bright community &quot;on the move&quot;, the city has fallen into ruin after the steel factories are closed and thousands of men lose their jobs. Gary &quot;Gaz&quot; is a former worker and about to lose his son because he can't pay for joint custody. His friends (and former co-workers) aren't doing much better: Dave is depressed and convinced his wife isn't interested in their marriage anymore; Lomper has to take care of his mom and is suicidal; and Gerald has been lying to his wife for six months about his unemployment. After stumbling across a Chipendales dance club and seeing how many women are paying for it (ten quid times a thousand women equals... &quot;a lot of money&quot;), Gaz realizes that if they can do it, so can he. The guys pull together, adding Horse and Guy to the line-up. But Gaz realizes that they have to offer something that the &quot;real thing&quot; doesn't... so these guys are going &quot;the full monty&quot;, which means going totally nude! They may not be young, they may not be pretty, they may not be very good, but they're there, and for one night only, with nothing to lose, they're daring to go The Full Monty!\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/jaocnaadl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/jaocnaadl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/jaocoaadl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/jaocoaadl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaocaaadl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaocaaadl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaocbaadl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/kaocbaadl.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a66400e4f27eab6abd077b4e247d6228ec0e978f","amp;dn":"The.Full.Monty.1997.x264.aac.11.Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a66400e4f27eab6abd077b4e247d6228ec0e978f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,100,0,228,242,126,171,106,189,7,123,78,36,125,98,40,236,14,151,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
