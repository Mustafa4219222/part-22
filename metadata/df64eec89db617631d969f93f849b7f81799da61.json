Born the oldest daughter into a musical family in Houston, TX, on Christmas Day, 1948, Mandrell was already reading music and playing accordion by the age of five. Just six years later, she was so adept at playing the steel guitar that her father escorted her to a music trade convention in Chicago, where her talents caught the attention of Chet Atkins and Joe Maphis. Soon after, she was a featured performer in Maphis' Las Vegas nightclub show, followed by television performances and tours with Red Foley, Johnny Cash, and Tex Ritter.\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMCA Nashville\nCatalog:\t\t0881701602\nIncludes:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Standing Room Only\n02.Married But Not To Each Other\n03.Woman To Woman\n04.Sleeping Single In A Double Bed\n05.(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right\n06.Years\n07.Crackers\n08.I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool (Duet With George Jones)\n09.'Till You're Gone\n10.One Of A Kind Pair Of Fools\n11.Happy Birthday Dear Heartache\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df64eec89db617631d969f93f849b7f81799da61","amp;dn":"20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+Barbara+Mandrell+%282000%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df64eec89db617631d969f93f849b7f81799da61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,100,238,200,157,182,23,99,29,150,159,147,248,73,183,248,23,153,218,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
