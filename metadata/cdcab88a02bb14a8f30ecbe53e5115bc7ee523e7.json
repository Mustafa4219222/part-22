The controversy generated by Cathy Come\r\nHome led to public outrage at the state of housing in Britain, and gave a welcome\r\nboost to the (coincidental) launch of the homelessness charity Shelter a few days\r\nafter the play was first broadcast, as part of the BBC's The Wednesday Play strand.\r\n\r\nThe play follows young lovers Cathy and Reg from the optimism of their early married\r\ndays through a spiral of misfortune that follows Reg's work accident, leading to\r\neviction and separation, and culminating, in what remains one of TV's most memorable\r\nscenes, in a hysterical Cathy having her children forcibly taken away by Social Services.\r\n\r\nThe success of Cathy established director Ken Loach as a politically committed filmmaker\r\nstanding apart from the commercial mainstream, and demonstrated again his sensitivity to\r\nhis usually working-class characters.\r\n\r\nOriginal release 16 November 1966 (UK)\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttps://imgmak.com/images/2016/08/01/1.png\r\n \nhttps://imgmak.com/images/2016/08/01/2.png\r\n\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/e96a5e66ea.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4 / MPEG-4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 897 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*408=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 321 Kbps [Stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1300 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 1h 17mn\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdcab88a02bb14a8f30ecbe53e5115bc7ee523e7","amp;dn":"+BBC+-+Cathy+Come+Home+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdcab88a02bb14a8f30ecbe53e5115bc7ee523e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,202,184,138,2,187,20,168,243,14,203,229,62,81,21,188,126,229,35,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
