He also removed his Twitter and Facebook accounts.\n\nThis is a beautiful song. His nylon string guitar, tuned down a full step to DGCFAD, is slightly out of tune, but his vocals are beautiful.\n\nRecorded using SoundFlower while streaming off a blog. Exported as 320kbps MP3 but may not be true bit-rate; unsure of the original upload quality.\n\nLYRICS:\n\nSo this is how it ends\nIn separate beds\nA wall between us\n\nAnd this is how it dies\nSeparate our lives\nIn hope it heals us\n\nI chose the love of strangers\nI chose the fickle crowd\nAnd the woman I wagered\n\nWonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t look at me right now, not now\n\nI know IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been like a house cat\nGive me this\nGive me that\n\nAnd I know IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be OK\nBut beg for my attention\nOr work for my affection\n\nI just stare and walk away\nHow can I show you\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d do all that I could do\n\nTo show you I adore you, Olivia\n\nAnd the days go by\nIn a supplicated style\nHand me the anodynes\n\nOh Olivia, I still love you\nAnd I know I will 'til I die\nAnd this feels like common madness\nWhy this wasted life? Come to me\n\nThe photographer is lucky;\nDoes he even know my name?\nDoes he know IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give it all up,\nIf I only could be him?\nBut I used all my chances\nAnd a few after that\nNow IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m floating in the ashes, Olivia\n\nAnd the days go by\nIn a supplicated style\nHand me the anodynes\n\nOh Olivia, I still love you\nAnd I know I will Ã¢â‚¬â„¢til I die\nAnd this feels like common madness\nWhy this wasted life? Come to me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e837ac1e6a7318f53813d82fba9ea446f935c7c","amp;dn":"Robin+Pecknold+-+Oliva%2C+In+A+Separate+Bed+-+320kbps+MP3+-+Poitra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e837ac1e6a7318f53813d82fba9ea446f935c7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,131,122,193,230,167,49,143,83,129,61,130,251,169,234,68,111,147,92,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
