After wresting control of the throne of Israel in a bloody civil war, David moves quickly to exterminate his enemies. He crucifies anyone who challenges his right to the throne and then turns his sword on his political enemies. Finally, David sets his sites on a new target--the beautiful Bathsheba, but she is already married. For someone like David this is a minor impediment. He sends her husband to his death in battle, a battle that eventually propels Israel into becoming an empire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bfba20f24466a1c8c9bffb85133c0ebe1b0a037","amp;dn":"Battles+BC+-+S01E02+-+David+-+The+GIant+Slayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bfba20f24466a1c8c9bffb85133c0ebe1b0a037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,251,162,15,36,70,106,28,140,155,255,184,81,51,192,235,225,176,160,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
