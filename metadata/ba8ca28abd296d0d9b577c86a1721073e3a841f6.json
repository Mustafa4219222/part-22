They enlist the aid of a local ski instructor, Gil Jackson, and plan to use him as a guide out of the territory after the robbery. However, a blizzard forces them to take refuge in Jackson's cabin, where Gypsy lowers the inside temperature by giving the cold shoulder to Ward, her former sweetie until she saw Jackson. Ward don't care, as he plans to kill Jackson after they have no further use of him. But they had used an explosion in a cave to serve as a distraction during the heist, and this explosion had irritated the big spider that lived there and, sure enough, all hands have to seek refuge in the cave from the fury of the storm. All but two of them would have been better off facing the South Dakota elements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8ca28abd296d0d9b577c86a1721073e3a841f6","amp;dn":"Beast+From+Haunted+Cave+%281959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8ca28abd296d0d9b577c86a1721073e3a841f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,140,162,138,189,41,109,13,155,87,124,134,161,114,16,115,227,168,65,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
