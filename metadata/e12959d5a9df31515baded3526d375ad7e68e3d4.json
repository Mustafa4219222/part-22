It is my prayer that you allow Him to set deep roots in your heart, and that perhaps by some small measure, He uses the messages within these Christian songs to keep you anchored, obedient, and humble.\n\nWe're now on our 11th bundle on the year.  For those keeping count at home, that brings us up 309 releases for 2013.  Not too bad for the first quarter of the year.\n\nFor anyone interested, here's a quick break down of this bundle.  Again, I may be off on some of my genres, but I have these listed accordingly.  For those looking for Rock, we have The Advice, Finding Favour, Hawk Nelson, JJ Weeks Band, Paramore, and Phil King.  For those Country fans out there, Alan Jackson just released his &quot;Precious Memories, Vol 2&quot; album to compliment Vol 1 from a few years back.  If you're looking for Hip-Hop / Rap, there's plenty to choose from including Andy Mineo, Benjah, Cheno Lyfe, Dorian Grey, Jadee Lamez, JG, Joey Prophet, and Selah The Corner.  Contemporary fans?  How about Anthem Lights and Michael English?  Under Pop you might enjoy Aprilemade, David Archuleta, and Shawn McDonald.  Under Praise &amp; Worship you might enjoy Bridge Music, and The Orchard Church.  If you're into something a little more heavy, we have four to choose from under the Metal / Hardcore genre including The Color Morale, Hope For The Dying, Phinehas, and Sinners To Saints.  Dance?  How about DJ Cmd.  Alternative?  How about LifePoint Music.  Or maybe you just want to relax to a nice Instrumental, then check out The Reveille.  And for Acoustic we have Ryan Furr's &quot;Hymns EP&quot; release.\n\nMore specifically, this 11th bundle includes the following 30 titles...\n\n * Advice, The - 2013 - The Advice\n * Alan Jackson - 2013 - Precious Memories, Vol 2\n * Andy Mineo - 2013 - Bitter - Single\n * Anthem Lights - 2013 - Anthem Lights Covers\n * Aprilemade - 2013 - The Hymn Project\n * Benjah - 2013 - Vanity Fare\n * Bridge Music - 2013 - Alive In Him - Single\n * Cheno Lyfe - 2013 - Falling Up\n * Color Morale, The - 2013 - Know Hope\n * David Archuleta - 2013 - No Matter How Far\n * DJ Cmd - 2013 - Dance 65 - Blessings\n * Dorian Grey - 2013 - Morning Star - Single\n * Finding Favour - 2013 - Finding Favour EP\n * Hawk Nelson - 2013 - Made\n * Hope For The Dying - 2013 - Aletheia\n * Jadee Lamez - 2013 - 100 Kings  - Heartless Ambition EP\n * JG - 2013 - The Story\n * JJ Weeks Band - 2013 - All Over The World\n * Joey Prophet - 2013 - Starve The Flesh Feed The Spirit\n * LifePoint Music - 2013 - Freedom - Single\n * Michael English - 2013 - Some People Change\n * Orchard Church, The - 2013 - Atmospheres\n * Paramore - 2013 - Paramore\n * Phil King - 2013 - Phil King\n * Phinehas - 2013 - The Bridge Betwee EP\n * Reveille, The - 2013 - Instrumental Songs For Study And Reflection\n * Ryan Furr - 2013 - Hymns EP\n * Selah The Corner - 2013 - Hoodie Season\n * Shawn McDonald - 2013 - The Analog Sessions\n * Sinners To Saints - 2013 - The Greatest Of These\n\nFor Him,\nTorrentTracts - March 2013\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e12959d5a9df31515baded3526d375ad7e68e3d4","amp;dn":"2013+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+11%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e12959d5a9df31515baded3526d375ad7e68e3d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,41,89,213,169,223,49,81,91,173,237,53,38,211,117,173,126,104,227,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
