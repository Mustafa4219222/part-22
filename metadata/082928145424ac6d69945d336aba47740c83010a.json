The series started (like Nexus and Badger) with Capital Comics, later moving to First Comics when Capital shut down. This torrent contains all issues from Capital and First, and also includes a one-shot done for Boom! in 2006.\n\nAs always, praise to the creative teams and scanners! Get it, seed it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082928145424ac6d69945d336aba47740c83010a","amp;dn":"Whisper+%28First+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082928145424ac6d69945d336aba47740c83010a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,41,40,20,84,36,172,109,105,148,93,51,106,186,71,116,12,131,1,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
