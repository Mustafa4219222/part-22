An Ann Arbor, Michigan native and Brooklyn resident, Halo began playing piano at age six and added guitar and violin to her repertoire while still a child. However, she didn't begin composing until she was 19, using not only the classical theory of her childhood but her fascination with translating geometric shapes like arcs and domes into music and the sounds she absorbed as a free-form DJ at the University of Michigan's radio station WCBN as touchstones for her work. \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a98afbb17a1008f78819f39d8dc6091dc18c0cad","amp;dn":"Laurel+Halo+-+Quarantine+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a98afbb17a1008f78819f39d8dc6091dc18c0cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,138,251,177,122,16,8,247,136,25,243,157,141,198,9,29,193,140,12,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
