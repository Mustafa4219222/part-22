The song is noted for its militaristic drumbeat, simple but harsh guitar, and melodic harmonies. One of U2's most overtly political songs, its lyrics describe the horror felt by an observer of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, mainly focusing on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry where British troops shot at civil rights marchers.\n\nThe single was released in March 1983 in Germany and The Netherlands only; &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; was released instead in other territories. Along with &quot;New Year's Day&quot;, the song helped U2 reach a wider listening audience. It was generally well-received by critics on the album's release.\n\nThe song has remained a staple of U2's live concerts. During its earliest performances, the song created controversy. Bono reasserted the song's anti-hate, anti-sectarian-violence message to his audience for many years. Today, it is considered one of U2's signature songs, being one of the band's most performed songs. Critics rate it among the best political protest songs, and it has been covered by over a dozen artists. It was named the 268th greatest song by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\n\nAlthough a promotional music video had not been produced for the original release, the band used footage from a 5 June 1983 live performance to promote the song. Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky, directed by Gavin Taylor, displays Bono's use of a white flag during performances of the song. The video highlights the intensity and emotion felt by many audience members during U2's concerts, while the rainy, torch-lit setting in Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheatre further adds to the atmosphere. In 2004, Rolling Stone cited the performance as one of fifty moments that changed the history of rock and roll, and noted that &quot;[t]he sight of Bono singing the anti-violence anthem 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' while waving a white flag through crimson mist (created by a combination of wet weather, hot lights and the illumination of those crags) became the defining image of U2's warrior-rock spirit andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½shown in heavy rotation on MTVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½broke the band nationwide.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c0c8109c50d6acb66396ed89447d63409802d87","amp;dn":"U2+-+Sunday+Bloody+Sunday","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c0c8109c50d6acb66396ed89447d63409802d87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,12,129,9,197,13,106,203,102,57,110,216,148,71,214,52,9,128,45,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
