It was written and composed by Theron Thomas, Terry Thomas and Brian Kennedy, and produced by Kennedy for Hudson's debut album Jennifer Hudson (2008).\n\nHudson shot a music video for the track in Los Angeles on January 26, 2009 with director Diane Martel. The video premiered February 11, 2009 on AOL, Entertainment Tonight, and 106 &amp; Park. So far the video has peaked to #2 on BET's 106 &amp; Park and continues to climb higher as of March 30, 2009\n\nAllmusic said that &quot;Hudson's voice is smoothed out through the fluttery &quot;If This Isn't Love&quot; (not to mention spiked with grating male grunts of &quot;Hey!&quot;), nearly unrecognizable until the point where she belts.&quot;.Slant magazine said that &quot; 'If This Isn't Love' succeeds at sounding completely modern without eschewing the standard adult-contemporary song structure that's tailor-made for pipes like Hudson's.&quot;\n\nDigital Spy said &quot;'If This Isn't Love' is a delicate love song that finds Hudson in her natural comfort zone. &quot;God sent me an angel from above, that's going to love me for life,&quot; she sings soulfully, with recent events making the lyrics particularly resonant. Combining modish beats with a cool, breezy chorus, 'If This Isn't Love' may not be in the same league as recent power ballads from BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Leona, but it has an understated charm that's hard to quibble with&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0adff96f0b2778f987a8846ccb3608fbd3936a65","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Hudson+-+If+This+Isn%5C%27t+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0adff96f0b2778f987a8846ccb3608fbd3936a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,223,249,111,11,39,120,249,135,168,132,108,203,54,8,251,211,147,106,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
