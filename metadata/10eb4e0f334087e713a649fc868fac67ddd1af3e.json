The album as well as the first single from it are both titled 'No Guarantees'. Goya produced the album and wrote the songs with guitarist &amp; keyboardist Alex Blanc. The group's video, shot in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Los Angeles, aired on MTV that year. The single, 'No Guarantees', was used in Michael Apted's movie 'Firstborn', starring Peter Weller &amp; Teri Garr (1984) and in episode 27, 'Buddies', of the television series 'Miami Vice'.\n\nPersonal observation: If you're a fan of Wall of Voodoo or Stan Ridgeway, you'll appreciate Safeway Goya's style, he has a similar if not subdued drawl and howl in his vocal style. The band has a fairly electronic sound to it, never super synthy and sometimes surprisingly orchestral (you'll catch violin and sax riffs from time to time).\n\nCredits\nLead Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Safeway Goya\nGuitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alex Blanc, Eric Garcia, Ken Ypparila\nKeyboards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alex Blanc, Ken Ypparila\nBass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eric Garcia\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Timex Burke\nViolin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ken Ypparila\nVocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alex Blanc\nWritten By Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Alex Blanc, Safeway Goya\nProducer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Safeway Goya, Sarco","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10eb4e0f334087e713a649fc868fac67ddd1af3e","amp;dn":"The+Nobodys+-+No+Guarantees+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10eb4e0f334087e713a649fc868fac67ddd1af3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,235,78,15,51,64,135,231,19,166,73,252,134,143,172,103,221,209,175,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
