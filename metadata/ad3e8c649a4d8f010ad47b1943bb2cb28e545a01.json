A moody, electro-pop singer/songwriter in the vein of Lorde and Ellie Goulding, Halsey has a resounding voice with just a dusting of grit. Badlands feels so ripped from her personal journalÃ¢â‚¬â€Ã¢â‚¬Å“I write songs about sex and being sad. I will never be anything but honest,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ reads her Instagram bioÃ¢â‚¬â€that one connects instantly with her freedom and vulnerability. And when she speaks truth on Ã¢â‚¬Å“CastleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Americana,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like the graduation speech youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always wanted to hear.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Castle 4:37\n02.
