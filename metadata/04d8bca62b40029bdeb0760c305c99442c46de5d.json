Their grief has led them to Sandy Hook Promise, a now-nationwide group founded by Newtown friends and neighbors to heal the hurt and find new ways to talk about and campaign against the scourge of gun violence in the United States.\n\nOne of their allies is folk singer Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary fame, who joined with the Wheelers and others in a February concert of harmony, resilience and solidarity.\n\nFrancine Wheeler and Peter Yarrow discuss with Bill the power of music to create change, and their mission to protect children and adults from gun violence in communities across America. We also see excerpts from the concert, soon to appear on many public television stations. Later, the conversation continues as David Wheeler joins his wife to talk about what can be done and if the gun issue can be addressed in a way that includes diverse viewpoints and bypasses partisan brinkmanship.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04d8bca62b40029bdeb0760c305c99442c46de5d","amp;dn":"The+Sandy+Hook+Promise-PBS+Moyers+and+Company+050313-avi+PTC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04d8bca62b40029bdeb0760c305c99442c46de5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,216,188,166,43,64,2,155,222,176,118,12,48,92,153,68,44,70,222,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
