Fergus is trying to find the one he left behind on the eve of their wedding, charmer and Rat Pack fanatic Frankie woos the beautiful Eleanor and the robber Eddie falls hopelessly in love with dowdy cemetery worker Jocelyn. Meanwhile, taxi driver Jimmy is transporting all of them and dealing with a love story of his own. In its own modest, genial terms, the picture succeeds. It never wants to be more than charming and sweet, and it invites us to imagine London as a cozy, happy, small town where coincidental encounters are everyday occurrences and muggers and their victims can put aside their misunderstandings and start dating.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 608x336, 25.000 fps, 920 Kbps, 01h32m11s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Czech, Dutch, English, French, Serbian, Spanish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/nks1t77fv/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/s764iz675/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/paj3ip0dd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jdf81vj8h/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/m4yhshhr5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4be8222969df655a86fcfd5d20e3b8813f6bcb4a","amp;dn":"Born+Romantic+%282000+-+UK%29+%5Bmulti+subs%5D+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4be8222969df655a86fcfd5d20e3b8813f6bcb4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,232,34,41,105,223,101,90,134,252,253,93,32,227,184,129,63,107,203,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
