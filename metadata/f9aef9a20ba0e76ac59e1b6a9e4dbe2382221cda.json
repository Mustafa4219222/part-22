The youngest son Saburo protests and is banished from the kingdom. But instead of fulfilling their father's wishes, eldest brother Taro, now in charge, and his middle brother Jiro are disloyal to the former lord and attack his castle. Hidetora survives, but, following his sons' betrayal, is now losing his mind. When Jiro has his brother murdered, the banished Saburo and his allies return to fight a battle against the remaining brother.\r\n\r\nIn Japanese with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 25 (~2217Kbps)\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1038\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1\r\nFrames Rate: 24 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~140Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2 (Japanese)\r\nRun-Time: 159 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 2.62 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Embedded and merged English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9aef9a20ba0e76ac59e1b6a9e4dbe2382221cda","amp;dn":"Ran+1985+1080p+HDTV+x264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9aef9a20ba0e76ac59e1b6a9e4dbe2382221cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,174,249,162,11,160,231,106,197,158,27,106,158,77,190,35,130,34,28,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
