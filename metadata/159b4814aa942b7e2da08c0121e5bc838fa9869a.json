Stich, &quot;Mindreading: An Integrated Account of Pretence, Self-Awareness, and Understanding Other Minds&quot;\nEnglish | 2003-10-09 | ISBN: 0198236093, 0198236107 | 248 pages | PDF | 221 mb\n\nThe everyday capacity to understand the mind, or 'mindreading', plays an enormous role in our ordinary lives. Shaun Nichols and Stephen Stich provide a detailed and integrated account of the intricate web of mental components underlying this fascinating and multifarious skill. The imagination, they argue, is essential to understanding others, and there are special cognitive mechanisms for understanding oneself. The account that emerges has broad implications for longstanding philosophical debates over the status of folk psychology.\n\nMindreading is another trailblazing volume in the prestigious interdisciplinary Oxford Cognitive Science series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:159b4814aa942b7e2da08c0121e5bc838fa9869a","amp;dn":"Mindreading%3A+An+Integrated+Account+of+Pretence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"159b4814aa942b7e2da08c0121e5bc838fa9869a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,155,72,20,170,148,43,126,45,160,140,1,33,229,188,131,143,169,134,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
