More than living up to the hype, the film went on to a successful release on a VHS, but as of 2006, remains thankfully unavailable on DVD, with good reason: Despite the misleadingly innocuous title, this is heavy stuff indeed though rewarding for those who can take a hefty dose of angst with their grue. The film lingers on in your head, rattling around like a nightmare too hellish to forget.\n\nThe denouement of Centipede Curse is extremely gruesome; Sam Raimi says this is the most frightening movie he has ever seen, and its likely to stay in the mind of many viewers for quite some time afterwards. You&amp;#039;ll have seen gorier, for sure, but seldom has such grue been delivered with such solemn conviction. It is thoroughly nasty, and even I, a David Cronenberg fan, had to watch it through my fingers! If you don&amp;#039;t find the sight of a woman belching up a series of over-bloated centipede husks and assorted maggots out her own throat disturbing, I fear for your sanity... \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fapomatic.com/show.php?loc=0746&amp;f=vlcsnap94674.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fapomatic.com/show.php?loc=0746&amp;f=vlcsnap94674.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://fapomatic.com/show.php?loc=0746&amp;f=vlcsnap94392.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://fapomatic.com/show.php?loc=0746&amp;f=vlcsnap94392.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nlater/FFF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:849be600d69fcf245c02846e3eab7d1761312d1e","amp;dn":"Centipede+Horror................FFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"849be600d69fcf245c02846e3eab7d1761312d1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,155,230,0,214,159,207,36,92,2,132,110,62,171,125,23,97,49,45,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
