Let's Try Khizr Khan!\r\nRUSH: The Politico Caucus is Republican insiders. Well, not all, but the Republicans that are part of the Caucus, they're insiders.  They are think tankers, consultants, political operatives.  And they think Trump ought to drop out.  I've been thinking about that.  If Trump drops out, who would be ideal to take over for Trump?  I put a lot of thought into that during the most recent break, folks.  I think I've got a suggestion...\r\n\r\nExamining the Trump Effect\r\n\r\ndata on Trump.  But peer pressure is something profound and with the media all-in for Hillary and, furthermore, with the media now going all Palin on Trump, it's the same situation.\r\n\r\nRUSH: I'm telling you as I was telling Mr. Snerdley this morning, &quot;The media has gone all Palin on Trump now.  They've gone all Palin.&quot;  Folks, there's no doubt what is going on.  The media is trying to take Donald Trump out... The big story is not Obama paying ransom for hostages, because the big story is Donald Trump mistakenly saying he saw a video.  The big story is not even Obama denying that it was ransom, even though it was.  The big story is not Hillary and John Kerry and the press secretary all lying about it.  They've all said, &quot;It wasn't ransom!&quot; They've all said, &quot;There's nothing to see here.&quot;  They've all said, &quot;It wasn't nefarious.&quot;  But that wasn't the big story.  The big story is that Trump tweeted out that he actually saw a video of this happening. \r\n\r\nCNN Pans Trump's Economic Advisors: Too White, Too Male, Too Rich\r\n \nhttp://www.rushlimbaugh.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b184dc6e2d0a32ccd25527129e896ae8939e8d5c","amp;dn":"Rush+Limbaugh+August+5%2C+2016+Full+Podcast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b184dc6e2d0a32ccd25527129e896ae8939e8d5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,132,220,110,45,10,50,204,210,85,39,18,158,137,106,232,147,158,141,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
