That's right, folks, they ripped-off our labor of love to make a few bucks. But why pay for it when it was intended to be free from the very outset of the project?)\n\nOn April 9, 1991, Yes debuted its 8-man line-up and kicked off the Union world. Not one but TWO video cameras captured the momentous event. \n\nNow, for the first time ever, TooleManTVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFirst UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ presents the union of these two videos. Every note of the first concert by this legendary line-up is captured here. \n\nThis is no ordinary single-cam fan video. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFirst UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cuts between the two camera angles like a professionally edited video, bringing you up-close with each member of Yes as they take solos and share the spotlight. \n\nThis two-DVD set features a fantastic Dolby Digital 5.1 mix of the stereo sound recorded by the two cameras. The video comes from high-quality direct transfers of copies of the original camcorder tapes, which were destroyed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina! These are not re-authored single-disk DVD's in lower quality, which is what you get from the Gonzo version and other rip-offs. \n\nPrepare to be blown away by the opening night excitement!\n\nTheTooleMan\nSeptember, 2010\n\nYes line-up:\nJon Anderson\nBill Bruford\nSteve Howe\nTony Kaye\nTrevor Rabin\nChris Squire\nRick Wakeman\nAlan White\n\nDisk 1:\nFirebird Suite\nYours Is No Disgrace\nRhythm Of Love\nCity Of Love\nHeart Of The Sunrise\nLeaves Of Green\nConcerto In D/Clap\nMake It Easy/Owner Of A Lonely Heart\nAnd You And I\nDrum Duet\nHold On\nShock To The System\nSolly's Beard\n\nDisk 2:\nChanges\nTake The Water To The Mountain\nSoon\nLong Distance Runaround\nWhitefish\nAmazing Grace\nLift Me Up\nWakeman Solo\nAwaken\nRoundabout\nStarship Trooper\n\nLineage: 8mm camcorder tapes -&gt; VHS -&gt; DVD -&gt; TooleManTVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s editing suite -&gt; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFirst UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNote: the original 8mm camcorder tapes and first-gen VHS copies were lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe DVD's made from the first-gen VHS copies are the best available sources that exist. Other copies, including the Gonzo single-disk version, have been re-authored and suffer from a further loss in quality. \n\nApproximately 25% of the show was captured by only one of the cameras. Between the two cameras, the entire show was recorded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:569c42c730d8eccea300b96fa39ee9b560e04635","amp;dn":"Yes+First+Union+DVD+1991-04-09+Pensacola+FL+by+TooleMan+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"569c42c730d8eccea300b96fa39ee9b560e04635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,156,66,199,48,216,236,206,163,0,185,111,163,158,233,181,96,224,70,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
