Their \nmusic is characterised by the vocals, acoustic guitar, and flute playing of Ian Anderson, \nwho has led the band since its founding, and the guitar work of Martin Barre, who has been \nwith the band since 1969.\n\nInitially playing blues rock with an experimental flavour, they have also incorporated \nelements of classical music, folk music, jazz, hard rock and art rock into their music.\n\nOne of the world's best-selling music artists, the band have sold more than 60 million \nalbums worldwide in a career that has spanned more than forty years.\n\nA Passion Play is a concept album, and the sixth studio album, released by Jethro Tull. \nApparently concerning the spiritual journey of one man in the afterlife, it is similar \nto Thick as a Brick in that it is one long track split across both sides of the LP vinyl \nrecord, save for the interruption of the oddly whimsical spoken-word piece &quot;The Story of \nthe Hare Who Lost His Spectacles&quot; (a section that is very similar to, and probably parodies, \nSergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf) Upon its release in 1973, it received generally \nnegative reviews; nevertheless, it sold well enough to reach #1 on the charts in the \nUnited States. In the United Kingdom, however, it did not do as well, reaching #13\n\n\n\n   1. Jethro Tull - Lifebeats                                    [01:13]\n   2.
