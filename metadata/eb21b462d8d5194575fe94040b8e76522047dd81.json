All output from these functions is displayed in the Information Console. All functions are run in the background and the GUI is disabled to prevent running multiple functions, as this could conflict or damage Office 2010. The Channel Switcher, AutoKMS Uninstaller, AutoRearm Uninstaller, Office Uninstaller and Product Key Checker work even if Office 2010 is not installed. For information about individual functions.

WARNING: Windows 8 is NOT officially supported and many functions have issues, especially Restore.\n- Fixes numerous registry issues created during migration back to .NET 3.5. This was a cause for bugs in quite a few functions.\n- Removed &quot;Check for Program Updates&quot; (Users of earlier builds need update soon as I will remove this info which may cause annoying errors)\n- Repairing Office 2010 should no longer involve extra setup boxes on non x86-64 Office Architecture.\n- Replaced Windows 8 DP Key with Windows 8 CP Key.\n\n====================================================================================\nNote: If You Have Problem With Any Of my Torrents Register To My Site And PM Me About Your  Problem: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.org/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n====================================================================================\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb21b462d8d5194575fe94040b8e76522047dd81","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Toolkit+v2.3.1++%5BThumperDC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb21b462d8d5194575fe94040b8e76522047dd81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,33,180,98,216,213,25,69,117,254,148,4,11,142,118,82,32,71,221,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
