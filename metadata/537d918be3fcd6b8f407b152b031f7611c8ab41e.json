Drink milk, eat ice-cream, collect coins, buy gorgeous boosts, fly like a superhero (sorry... supercat), jump onto platforms made of cake, avoid angry dogs, and discover the infinite space. And that's not all, you can choose from multiple game modes, where you can play with Nyan Cat's evil foe Tac Nayn, learn to fly on different planets with Nyan Wings or visit parallel universes. If you're tired, you can even train and feed your own Nyanagotchi. Oh, and last but not least: you can enjoy the wonderful Nyan-song as many times as you want! All this funky stuff can't be missed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:537d918be3fcd6b8f407b152b031f7611c8ab41e","amp;dn":"Nyan+Cat%3A+Lost+In+Space+v1.0.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"537d918be3fcd6b8f407b152b031f7611c8ab41e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,125,145,139,227,252,214,184,244,7,177,82,176,49,247,97,28,138,180,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
