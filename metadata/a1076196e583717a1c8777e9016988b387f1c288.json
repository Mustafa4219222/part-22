November 13, 2003\n&quot;Having had the rare opportunity to attend this show with many other &quot;Fumblers&quot; (Sarah fans for those who may not know), this show holds a lot of memories for me. Not only because I attended it with friends, but because this taping was by far one of the best performances I have ever seen of Sarah. Of course, being two feet away might have clouded my judgement a bit.\nRecorded on her 30th birthday, it also captured Sarah at the height of promoting &quot;Surfacing&quot;, having just finished the first year of Lilith Fair the year before. A consummate performer, Sarah&amp;#039;s performance was not only technically brilliant but also filled with extreme passion.\n... (edit). She is one of those rare performers who doesn&amp;#039;t display a sense of ego while doing what she does best. A must-have.&quot;\n\n\nAmazon.com reviewer: Y. Slayton (Washington)\n5 out of 5 stars: May 29, 2006\n&quot;I&amp;#039;ve been listening to Sarah McLachlan for years and I saw this on &quot;VH1&quot; when it originally aired. If you taped Sarah McLachlan on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot; when it originally aired like I did and are a devoted fan, this is a must have DVD.\nThe feature performances are for &quot;Good Enough,&quot; &quot;Building a Mystery,&quot; &quot;Ice Cream,&quot; &quot;Sweet Surrender,&quot; &quot;Hold On,&quot; &quot;Elsewhere,&quot; &quot;Possession&quot; &quot;Witness&quot; and &quot;Angel.&quot; The last two performances are bonuses which weren&amp;#039;t on the original VH1 show. Sarah has a beautiful voice and very powerful words and this was truly an amazing DVD.\nI was moved by the passion and emotion and the meaning behind the lyrics. This DVD has terrific sound and features flawless live performances...(edit)&quot;\n\n\nActors: Sarah McLachlan, Paula Cole\nFormat: Color, Live, Dolby\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\nResolution: 720 x 528\nFramerate: 29.970 fps\nStudio: Image Entertainment\nDVD Release Date: January 6, 2004\nAudio Track: English (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo)\nSongs: Good Enough, Building a Mystery, Ice Cream, Sweet Surrender, Hold On, Elsewhere, Possession, Adia, Witness, Angel\n\n[IMG]http://i121.photobucket.com/albums/o222/Kibbles5757/Storytellers.jpg[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1076196e583717a1c8777e9016988b387f1c288","amp;dn":"Sarah+McLachlan+-+Live+performance+Nov+13th%2C+2003+-+VH1+Storytel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1076196e583717a1c8777e9016988b387f1c288","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,7,97,150,229,131,113,122,28,135,119,233,1,105,136,179,135,241,194,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
