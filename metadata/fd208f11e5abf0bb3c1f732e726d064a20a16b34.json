With its invention programmers no longer had to work at the level of the machine in ones and zeroes but could talk in terms of the problem they wanted solved. And those problems were the calculations that allowed everything from the space race to nuclear power to become a reality.\r\n\r\n2.Codes.That.Changed.The.World.Cobol.[MPup]\r\n\r\nRuntime: 15 minutes\r\n\r\nInefficient, verbose and ugly, yet by the 1990s, 80 per cent of the world's business software was written in Cobol. Aleks Krotoski explores why.\r\n\r\n3.Codes.That.Changed.The.World.Basic.[MPup]\r\n\r\nRuntime: 15 minutes\r\n\r\nBasic is the little language that could. As language of choice for home computing in the 1980s, it became iconic.\r\n\r\n4.Codes.That.Changed.The.World.Java.[MPup]\r\n\r\nRuntime: 15 minutes\r\n\r\nAleks Krotoski introduces the programming language that people probably interact with on a daily basis more than any other.\r\n\r\n5.Codes.That.Changed.The.World.The.Tower.of.Babel.[MPup]\r\n\r\nRuntime: 15 minutes\r\n\r\nToday's digital world is a reverse tower of Babel. It takes all sorts of different languages to build it. It is this phenomenon that Aleks Krotoski explores in this final edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd208f11e5abf0bb3c1f732e726d064a20a16b34","amp;dn":"Codes+That+Changed+The+World+Fortran+Cobol+Basic+Radio4+%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd208f11e5abf0bb3c1f732e726d064a20a16b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,32,143,17,229,171,240,187,60,31,115,46,114,109,6,74,32,161,107,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
