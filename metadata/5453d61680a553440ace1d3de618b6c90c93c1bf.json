Phase space analysis methods, including microlocal analysis, have yielded striking results in past years and have become one of the main tools of investigation. Equally important is their role in many applications to physics, for example, in quantum and spectral theories. \nKey topics: \n* The Cauchy problem for linear and nonlinear hyperbolic equations \n* Scattering theory \n* Inverse problems \n* Hyperbolic systems \n* Gevrey regularity of solutions of PDEs \n* Analytic hypoellipticity \nand unique features: \n* Original articles are self-contained with full proofs \n* Survey articles give a quick and direct introduction to selected topics evolving at a fast pace \nGraduate students at various levels as well as researchers in PDEs and related fields will find this an excellent resource. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5453d61680a553440ace1d3de618b6c90c93c1bf","amp;dn":"Phase+Space+Analysis+of+Partial+Differential+Equations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5453d61680a553440ace1d3de618b6c90c93c1bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,83,214,22,128,165,83,68,10,206,29,61,230,24,182,201,12,147,193,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
