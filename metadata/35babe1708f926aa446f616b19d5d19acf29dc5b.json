It has the distinction of being the worlds' first national park and is a lost world of vast plains, lush meadows and endless forests defended on all sides by towering mountains. It is the most extensive thermal area on earth with more than 10,000 boiling springs, fumaroles and bubbling mud pots and more geysers than the rest of the world put together. It's these strange natural wonders that first made Yellowstone famous and still make it unique today. It is also the natural beauty of Yellowstone combined with its iconic inhabitants that attract millions to visit every year. Home to America's last great Bison herds, the grizzly bear and realm of the grey wolf, this landmark series reveals the grandeur of this unique place as its animals struggle to survive over the course of the vividly changing seasons.\n\nJoin the charismatic cast of Yellowstone's wildlife as they turn to face the extreme challenges of the seasons and discover just what it takes to brave temperatures 40 degrees below zero, to live through raging forest fires or to fight to the death for the right to breed. The daily struggles of the wildlife are intimately linked to Yellowstone's greatest secret: that sleeping right beneath the snow is probably the world's largest volcano. The fate of everything in this extraordinary wilderness is in the hands of forces more powerful than we can possibly imagine.\n\n[b]Technical Specs[/b]\n------------------------------\n\n [b]*[/b] Total Size (MB) ....: ~746.00MB\n [b]*[/b] Total Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n [b]*[/b] Video Length .......: ~00:58:00\n [b]*[/b] Video Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\n [b]*[/b] Video Bitrate ......: ~1580 KB/s\n [b]*[/b] Resolution .........: 720 x 400\n [b]*[/b] Aspect Ratio .......: 1.80:1\n [b]*[/b] Quality Factor .....: 0.219 B/px\n [b]*[/b] Audio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\n [b]*[/b] Audio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\n [b]*[/b] Channels ...........: 2 Ch\n [b]*[/b] Sampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35babe1708f926aa446f616b19d5d19acf29dc5b","amp;dn":"BBC.Yellowstone.3of3.Autumn.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35babe1708f926aa446f616b19d5d19acf29dc5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,186,190,23,8,249,38,170,68,111,97,107,25,213,209,154,207,41,220,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
