While no one questions the quality of the music, some have been concerned that it was not necessarily a true live album. After all, that whole area gets tainted when overdubs and various post-production edit's are included. \n\nOver 20 years later, there is an answer to all the controversy in the form of Still Dangerous: Live at the Tower Theatre Philadelphia 1977. While it's no double album, Still Dangerous is still a masterfully mixed recording of two shows that Thin Lizzy performed back in October of 1977. Fans have the added pleasure of knowing that the tracks featured on the latest release have never been released and were actually discovered in a band lockup by accident. Scott Gorham went digging through some old Lizzy archive tapes and found this gem of a live show from LizzyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1977 Bad Reputation tour. \n\nAnother element that makes Still Dangerous a recording that can stand the test of time is Glyn Johns' amazing mixing throughout. He definitely deserves credit for turning a 1977 recording into something that has the quality of a contemporary live album. Johns' work allows the heart of the band to truly come through, which set the standard for musicianship in the 1970s.\n  \nEssential for any Lizzy fan.\n\n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e463d9cc8c6834abbf6e9bdd50f24d8a00d6f3ca","amp;dn":"Thin+Lizzy+-+Still+Dangerous+%2F+Live+in+Philadelphia+1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e463d9cc8c6834abbf6e9bdd50f24d8a00d6f3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,99,217,204,140,104,52,171,191,110,155,221,80,242,77,138,0,214,243,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
