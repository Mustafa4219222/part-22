Most of the audio is good too, but a couple of scenes have a tiny bit of distortion, as if some duplicate element had to be sourced. Nothing too alarming. The main disc has a commentary by Neil Sinyard that covers most of the general facts about the film quite well. The film's accurate but unappealing trailer mainly shows unhappy people yelling at one another. The short list of extras offer quality prime source material. The main attraction is critic Michel Ciment's Wilder interview docu Portrait of a &quot;60% Perfect Man&quot;: Billy Wilder. It was filmed in 1980 but carries a 1998 copyright. There are other documentary movies about Wilder but this one is bright and fast, and uncluttered with unnecessary film clips. Kirk Douglas appears in a friendly-enough 1984 interview that isn't all that informative, and we also get a look at a 1986 Wilder talk session at the AFI. Very welcome are some audio interview excerpts from co-writer Walter Newman, who talks about problems with the story and an original opening logo that incorporated a close-up of a rattlesnake. It had to be deleted because the studio thought it might frighten pregnant women.\n\nSpike Lee appears in a brief afterword expressing his admiration for the movie. A stills gallery rounds out the disc contents. A text insert has essays by Molly Haskell and Guy Maddin, and has been printed in the form of a fold-out tabloid newspaper. It even has an ad for the County Rattlesnake festival!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img512.imageshack.us/img512/2448/ace1fj4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img512.imageshack.us/img512/2448/ace1fj4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img412.imageshack.us/img412/1571/ace2te3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img412.imageshack.us/img412/1571/ace2te3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img512.imageshack.us/img512/8348/ace3lw5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img512.imageshack.us/img512/8348/ace3lw5.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------not my rip----------\n\ndual audio with commentary\n\n~~~~~~ Ace in the Hole.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n\n                                                               \n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,608,669,184                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \n\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.1.2 Final              \n\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:51:16                \n\nFrame Count:....................................160060             \n\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................592                  \n\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................432                  \n\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.370                     \n\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \n\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1562                 \n\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \n\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.255&quot;                     \n\n                                                                                \n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \n\nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \n\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \n\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \n\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \n\nAudio Channel Count:............................1        \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
