Passionately argued, brilliantly written, and filled with PagliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark audacity, Glittering Images takes us on a tour through more than two dozen seminal images, some famous and some obscure or unknownÃ¢â‚¬â€paintings, sculptures, architectural styles, performance pieces, and digital art that have defined and transformed our visual world. She combines close analysis with background information that situates each artist and image within its historical contextÃ¢â‚¬â€from the stone idols of the Cyclades to an elegant French rococo interior to Jackson PollockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s abstract Green Silver to RenÃƒÂ©e CoxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daring performance piece ChillinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with Liberty. And in a stunning conclusion, she declares that the avant-garde tradition is dead and that digital pioneer George Lucas is the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest living artist. Written with energy, erudition, and wit, Glittering Images is destined to change the way we think about our high-tech visual environment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f5b043caded2efd9fd5a79f71f81fa115503c5b","amp;dn":"Camille+Paglia+-+Glittering+Images%3A+A+Journey+Through+Art+from+E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f5b043caded2efd9fd5a79f71f81fa115503c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,91,4,60,173,237,46,253,159,213,167,159,113,248,31,161,21,80,60,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
