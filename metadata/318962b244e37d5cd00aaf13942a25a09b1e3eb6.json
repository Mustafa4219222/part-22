Unlike most other Hybrids, Gus was not born conventionally, but in a lab. Gus also predates the arrival of the Hybrid children and is believed to be the key to unlock the mysteries in this post-apocalyptic tale. Gus is joined with his &quot;protector&quot; Tommy Jepperd, Doctor Singh and a band of Hybrid children.
