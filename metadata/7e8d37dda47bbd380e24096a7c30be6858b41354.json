It also deals with other important topics hardly found in the literature, including the Robertson-Schrodinger-relation, angle and angular momentum uncertainties, interaction-free measurements, and the limitations of the no-cloning theorem.\n\nWith its interpretations of quantum mechanics and its discussions of quantum computing, this book is poised to become the standard textbook for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate quantum mechanics courses and as an essential reference for physics students and physics professionals.\n\n\nAbout The Authors\n\nMoses Fayngold is Special Lecturer at the Physics Department of the New Jersey Institute of Technology, where he is also involved in the research activities of the Multi-Disciplinary Optical Science and Engineering Program. He has been lecturing for some 20 years on special relativity, both to non-specialized audiences in public planetariums as well as to undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nVadim Fayngold holds two bachelor degrees - one in Physics and one in Computer Science. While being a research assistant at the Department of Computer Engineering (Polytechnic University, New York), he worked on computer simulation of complex processes in fluid dynamics. He won a scholarship in the REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program sponsored by the NSF National Science Foundation,) and had worked in the area of Plasma Physics at the University of California (Irvine). He acquired an extensive experience in computer simulation while participating in the MECO (Muon-Electron Conversion) project. Vadim Fayngold came to the idea of writing this book while working on computer animations of various relativistic and quantum-mechanical phenomena.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8d37dda47bbd380e24096a7c30be6858b41354","amp;dn":"Quantum+Mechanics+and+Quantum+Information+2013-+Moses+Fayngold+%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8d37dda47bbd380e24096a7c30be6858b41354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,141,55,221,164,123,189,56,14,36,9,106,124,48,190,104,88,180,19,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
