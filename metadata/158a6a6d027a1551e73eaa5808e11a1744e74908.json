Myths are proved true, probable, possible, improbable or busted. Often after the real-world practical tests have proved or debunked a Myth, the team will take the experiment to the extreme, many times using more modern technology than the myth could have used or upping the black powder for impressive explosions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158a6a6d027a1551e73eaa5808e11a1744e74908","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S12E07.Hypermiling.-.Crash.Cushions.HDTV.x264-KILLER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158a6a6d027a1551e73eaa5808e11a1744e74908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,138,106,109,2,122,21,81,231,62,170,88,8,225,26,23,68,231,73,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
