Now imagine feeling like an outsider in your own family.\n\nEvanston, Illinois. Lee Oliver Winekoop is born into extreme wealth, but despite his near genius IQ, he doesnÃŠÂ¾t have the resourcefulness to realize any of its benefits. His motherÃŠÂ¾s passive parenting style and frequent absences from their lakefront mansion leave him in the care of nannies as a child even when sheÃŠÂ¾s home, making Lee feel unwanted and alone. Further undermining his self-worth is his fatherÃŠÂ¾s inexplicable contempt toward him. If Lee only knew why his parents disliked him so, he would fix whatever it was he was doing wrong, and remove the invisible barrier that keeps him from fitting in.\n\nLee wants nothing more than to be like his two older brothersÃ¢â‚¬â€successful at everything they do, sons who make their parents proudÃ¢â‚¬â€even if it means buying into the familyÃŠÂ¾s philosophy that money is the answer to oneÃŠÂ¾s success in life.\n\nIn the thick of LeeÃŠÂ¾s discontent, his motherÃŠÂ¾s favorite uncle dies and leaves him a sizable inheritanceÃ¢â‚¬â€an inheritance with some bizarre strings attached. But as soon as he tries to start using it to mold an identity for himself, his world is turned upside-down when he learns shocking family secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€causing him to rethink who he is and where heÃŠÂ¾s going.\n\nGenre: Literary Fiction | Coming of Age","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd539319fbece03c8b447490ed54eadf5f023616","amp;dn":"Red+Clover+by+Florence+Osmund","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd539319fbece03c8b447490ed54eadf5f023616","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,83,147,25,251,236,224,60,139,68,116,144,237,84,234,223,95,2,54,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
