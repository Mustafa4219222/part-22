Five-time world kickboxing champion Cynthia Rothrock may be somewhat inexpressive in the lead role, but whatever she lacks in charisma is more than made up for by her sheer kick-ass athleticism--a trait director-cinematographer David Worth captures admirably. (In true exploitation-fu fashion, every impressive kick or punch is shown a minimum of three times at differing speeds.) Former 1970s action presence Robert Ginty (forever known to Mystery Science Theater 3000 fans as &quot;That Paper Chase Guy&quot;) lends an authoritatively stoic hand as a shady ally. Rothrock&amp;#039;s final coup de grace to beefcake baddie Richard Norton is guaranteed to inspire a collective sympathetic wince from male viewers. This full-frame DVD includes production notes, cast/crew bios, and the marvelously histrionic original trailer. --Andrew Wright \n\nActors: Cynthia Rothrock, Richard Norton, Robert Ginty, Bella Esperance, Hengky Tornando \n\nDirectors: David Worth (II) \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Lady-Dragon-Cynthia-Rothrock/dp/6305232717&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Lady-Dragon-Cynthia-Rothrock/dp/6305232717&lt;/a&gt;\n\n_________________\nTo Share is to Care!
