A horizon line, \nmaybe. But also a slot for blackness to pour through...\n\n----\n\nA terrible accident takes Edger Freemantle's right arm and \nscrambles his memory and his mind, leaving him little but rage as \nhe begins the ordeal of rehabilitation. When his marriage suddenly \nends, Edgar begins to wish he hadn't survived his injuries. He \nwants out. His psychologist suggests a new life distant from the \nTwin Cities, along with something else:\n\n&quot;Edgar, does anything make you happy?&quot;\n&quot;I used to sketch.&quot;\n&quot;Take it up again. You need hedges...hedges against the night.&quot;\n\nEdgar leaves for Duma Key, an eerily undeveloped splinter of the \nFlorida coast. The sun setting into the Gulf of Mexico calls out to \nhim, and Edgar draws. Once he meets Elizabeth Eastlake, a sick old \nwoman with roots tangled deep in Duma Key, Edgar begins to paint, \nsometimes feverishly; many of his paintings have a power that \ncannot be controlled. When Elizabeth's past unfolds and the ghosts \nof her childhood begin to appear, the damage of which they are \ncapable is truly devastating.\n\nThe tenacity of love, the perils of creativity, the mysteries of \nmemory and the nature of the supernaturalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stephen King gives us a \nnovel as fascinating as it is gripping and terrifying.\n\n----\n\nStephen King has written more than forty novels and two hundred \nshort stories. He is the recipient of the 2003 National Book \nFoundation Medal for Distinguished Contributions to American \nLetters and the Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for \nLifetime Achievement. In 2007 he was inducted as a Grand Master of \nthe Mystery Writers of America. Among his most recent bestsellers \nare Lisey's Story, Cell, the Dark Tower series, On Writing, The \nGreen Mile, and Bag of Bones. He lives in Bangor, Maine, with his \nwife, novelist Tabitha King.\n\n----\n\nJohn Slattery appears on film in Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our \nFathers, Charlie Wilson's War, and Reservation Road. Other films \ninclude Mona Lisa Smile, Bad Company, Traffic, The Station Agent \nand Sleepers. His extensive TV work includes regular roles on the \ncritical hit Mad Men, Desperate Housewives, K Street and memorable \nguest appearances on Sex and the City, and Will &amp; Grace.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nREAD ME!: On CD 13 and CD 16 there were small damaged areas \nscratched from the tops of the discs. On each disc it was in nearly \nthe same area, about 1.5 cm in from the outer edge. EAC did not \ngive any errors but there may be some corruption as a result \nroughly 3/4 through on each of these discs. I hope it does not ruin \nthe experience in any way.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce432036151ee8000f9ec82f8c30120dbf3a880e","amp;dn":"Stephen+King+-+Duma+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce432036151ee8000f9ec82f8c30120dbf3a880e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,67,32,54,21,30,232,0,15,158,200,47,140,48,18,13,191,58,136,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
