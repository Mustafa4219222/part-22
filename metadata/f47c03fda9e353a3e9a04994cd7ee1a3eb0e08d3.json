They are everywhere. Check out the Latest here. They are from The Fallen Angels.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nFallen Angel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Incursions have they happened and will they happen again in human affairs?\n\nHave fallen angels in the ancient past mated with humankind? Mythology the world over would teach us that they have. They have been the kernel of truth behind the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkest myths. They have been the truth behind the gods taking human woman and creating demigods. They gave rise to a race of beings the world over which built the pyramids and megaliths the world over. The evidence of which is found in the tales, folklore, and traditions of many cultures around the world.\n\nFirst Incursion\n\nMany have augured the reality of the incursion of these Fallen Angels into our realm, but the evidence is overwhelming. In one of humanityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oldest writings, the Fallen Angels are called the beney Ã¢â‚¬Ëœelohim. Some ancient texts call them the Watchers.\n\n   There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Gen 6:4)\n\nIt has been the opinion of Rabbinical Scholars, and the translators of the Septuagint that angels co-habited with the daughters of Adam. The early church agreed with this view. Justin Marty, Cyprian, Eusebius, and even Josephus a historical writer accepted this view. Justin Marty (the earliest of the church fathers) in his Second Apology wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Angels lusted after woman, and beget giants. These giants upon death became the demons.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJustin Marty (the earliest of the church fathers) in his Second Apology wrote, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Angels lusted after woman, and beget giants. These giants upon death became the demons.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis cohabitation with human females resulted in an offspring called Ã¢â‚¬Å“NephilimÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The King James Version says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“GiantsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Giants in the Hebrew text are described as those Ã¢â‚¬Å“who ruined the worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (by their violence, (Enoch vii. 3, 4). They comprise three classes: the original giants, who begot the Nephilim, to whom in turn, were born the Elouid (Book of Enoch, vii. 2) and the Elouid beget the Eloj. This mingling was disastrous for humanity. The mingling of angel and human is a fact reported somewhat as a matter of fact in Genesis. That these other worldly beings could take upon themselves flesh is clearly evidenced by AbrahamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversation with angels on their way to destroy Sodom who appeared as humans and even eat food. It also is the most natural reading of the verse in light of their offspring being giants.\n\nAngels can change into physical form even though by nature they are spirit beings. The Bible does not tell us how this happens, but it refers to angels Ã¢â‚¬Å“which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jude 6-7. Jude gives us an understanding of fallen angels and their interaction with humanity and of those who resist such knowledge are called, Ã¢â‚¬Å“brute beastsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nIt might be noted, that in the New Testament it is said that angels do not marry; it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say they are incapable of marriage, or that they have never participated in marriage; it also must be noted that the New Testament is talking about the honorable angels, not wicked angels, the point the New Testament is making is that people will not marry in heaven, Jesus is not illuminating the sexual activities of angels. The point the New Testament is making is that the institution of marriage in heaven isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t necessary.\n\nWickedness continued to increase, and fornication by the fallen angels rampaged throughout the Earth. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Then came the flood upon the earth, namely, owing to the fornication wherein the Watchers against the law of their ordinances went a whoring after the daughters of men, and took themselves wives of all which they chose: and they made the beginning of uncleanness. And they begat sons, the Nephilim, and they were all unlike, and they devoured one another: and the Giants slew one man another Ã¢â‚¬Å“(Book of Jubilees). The mating of the sons of God with humans did not end after the flood. The short statement Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦in those days; and also after thatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, refers to the fact that the fallen angels, the sons of God, continued to sin with the daughters of men.\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
