The main creative team of Geoff Johns and Francis Manapul debuted in a backup story in Adventure Comics #0 (April 2009). A secondary feature starring the Legion of Super-Heroes was co-written with Mike Shoemaker and drawn by Clayton Henry. The first issue of the new run of Adventure Comics was released on August 12, 2009, and features watermarked numbering marking it as both #1 and #504, thus continuing the original numeration of the series concurrently with the volume 2 numeration. For the variant incentive cover editions, the original numeration was dominant on the cover while the vol. 2 numeration was the watermarked numbering marking. The indicia of the comic book also reflects this dual numbering.\n\nSuperboy: The Boy of Steel\n\nThe revived ongoing title Adventure Comics features Conner as the headlining character for the first six issues in the story arc entitled, &quot;Superboy: The Boy of Steel.&quot; It begins as Conner settles back into his life in Smallville, Kansas. Returning to live with Martha Kent, who is thrilled to take the young boy in after her husband's death, Conner returns to Smallville High School and begins keeping a journal of everything Superman has done as a costumed hero, going down a checklist titled, &quot;What Did Superman Do?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b9d39eb6ee42816a9cd4d35db6dcbb0b864f0b1","amp;dn":"ADVENTURE+COMICS+000-006+%282009-10%29+%28Superboy+-+The+Boy+of+Steel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b9d39eb6ee42816a9cd4d35db6dcbb0b864f0b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,157,57,235,110,228,40,22,169,205,77,53,219,109,203,176,184,100,240,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
