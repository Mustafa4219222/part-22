I think, this can be helpful to many other BigFish Games and GOG games. It is a web setup, that means you need to connected to internet while installing this. Just run the setup file and it will download all of the required files. It might ask for a reboot. Do so and you are done. No need to un-install the games already installed and it has no effect on any other games or softwares. I installed this after installing Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy and it worked. Hope this will help. :)\n\nI have seen many guys are complaining for not to able the games of nancy Drew series due to lack of proper Direct X version. This will help as it helped me.\n\nEnjoy guys and gals. And if you are satisfied, please leave some decent comments. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1be7baa31e1b8488199d7825b0e9d8fd38b31cb","amp;dn":"directx+for+nancy+drew+games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1be7baa31e1b8488199d7825b0e9d8fd38b31cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,190,123,170,49,225,184,72,129,153,215,130,91,14,157,143,211,139,49,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
