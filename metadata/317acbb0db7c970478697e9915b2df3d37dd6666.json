The family-friendly dishes have been scaled down and professionally tested so that every home cook can turn out a meal just like the made-from-scratch versions featured at Juniorâ€™s. In Juniorâ€™s signature style, all dishes are delicious, â€œbigger and better than ever,â€ and perfect for both family meal and holiday table.\r\n\r\nJust like Juniorâ€™s other three books, this one will feature sidebars throughout on â€œThe Juniorâ€™s Wayâ€â€•tips and techniques to ensure the recipe turns out just as it should. In addition, ideas for â€œsuper-sizingâ€ a recipe to feed 8 or more will be included. Juniorâ€™s fabulous recipes will be showcased by more than 40 full-page, four-color photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:317acbb0db7c970478697e9915b2df3d37dd6666","amp;dn":"Junior%27s+Home+Cooking+%282013%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"317acbb0db7c970478697e9915b2df3d37dd6666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,122,203,176,219,124,151,4,120,105,126,153,21,178,223,61,55,221,102,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
