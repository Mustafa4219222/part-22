In Macrowikinomics, authors Don Tapscott and Anthony D. Williams take the principles of openness, collaboration, sharing, integrity and interdependence that they first outlined in Wikinomics and explain how these same concepts have a broader application than business practices and may be applied on a more global scale. Specifically, they consider government, financial service, automotive, healthcare, education and media industries.\n\nDuration: 20h 16min\nFormat: MP3 64 kbps\nOfficial site: http://www.macrowikinomics.com\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d85e99e505d9e30639b01684e0f9b3a63e00eb6","amp;dn":"Macrowikinomics%3A+Rebooting+Business+and+the+World+%282010%29+Audiobo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d85e99e505d9e30639b01684e0f9b3a63e00eb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,133,233,158,80,93,158,48,99,155,1,104,78,15,155,58,99,224,14,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
