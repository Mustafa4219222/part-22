Other bestselling works of neurobiology and the mind have focused on mental illness and abnormal behaviorsÃ¢â‚¬â€like the Oliver Sacks classic, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a HatÃ¢â‚¬â€but The Other Side of Normal is an eye-opening, thought-provoking, utterly fascinating and totally accessible exploration of the universals of human experience. It will change forever our understanding of who we are and what makes us that way.\n\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12b14f35ff572ef6b1311f70a1599967bcfebf2","amp;dn":"The+Other+Side+of+Normal+%282012%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12b14f35ff572ef6b1311f70a1599967bcfebf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,43,20,243,95,245,114,239,107,19,17,247,10,21,153,150,123,207,235,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
