He leads the Ivo Papazov Wedding Band \nin performances of jazz-infused Stambolovo music, and is one of the premier creators \nof the genre known as &quot;wedding band&quot; music in Bulgaria, along with the violinist \nGeorgi Yanev, saxophonist Yuri Yunakov and accordionists Neshko Neshev, Ivan Milev \nand Peter Ralchev. Together with Emilia they are known as Mames 2001. An orchestra \nthat had great success in the TV show &quot;Guess who is under the table&quot;.\n\nAccording to Garth Cartwright, he was &quot;the first Balkan Gypsy musician to win a \nwide international following with his two Joe Boyd-produced albums for Hannibal \nRecords in the early 1990s.&quot; Papasov and his Wedding Band have toured the United \nStates several times.\n\nIn 2005 Papasov won the Audience Award from the BBC's Radio3 World Music Awards.\n\nIvo Papasov was born to a Gypsy family in Bulgaria and his original name is \nIbrahim (Turkish name). As a result of the extensive programme of forced \nnationalisation of ethnic minority groups during Bulgaria's socialist rule, \nPapazov changed his first name to Ivo (adapted from Ibo, short for Ibrahim). \nHe speaks Turkish and comes from Kardzhali, a city close to BulgariaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Turkish \nand Greek borders. He grew up in a musical family and followed the Balkan \nGypsy tradition of leaving school at a young age to focus on playing music \nfor a living.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7d180dfd74c47cfa1ee87e7426219a5e63ad6b","amp;dn":"Ivo+Papasov+Bulgarian+Wedding+Band+Orpheus+Ascending+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7d180dfd74c47cfa1ee87e7426219a5e63ad6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,125,24,13,253,116,196,124,250,30,232,126,116,38,33,154,94,99,173,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
