Rangaiah (Wiley, 2016).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-119-01633-5\r\n\r\nThe proposed book will be divided into three parts. The chapters in Part I provide an overview of certain aspect of process retrofitting. The focus of Part II is on computational techniques for solving process retrofit problems. Finally, Part III addresses retrofit applications from diverse process industries.\r\n\r\nSome chapters in the book are contributed by practitioners whereas others are from academia. Hence, the book includes both new developments from research and also practical considerations. Many chapters include examples with realistic data. All these feature make the book useful to industrial engineers, researchers and students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40e48860e82e5c300179ad60b6a8aa98bce2e534","amp;dn":"Chemical+Process+Retrofitting+and+Revamping+-+Techniques+and+App","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40e48860e82e5c300179ad60b6a8aa98bce2e534","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,228,136,96,232,46,92,48,1,121,173,96,182,168,170,152,188,226,229,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
