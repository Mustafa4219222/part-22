Records. Co-produced by the band and Scott Litt, Monster was an intentional stylistic shift from the group's preceding albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), consisting of loud, distorted guitar tones and simple \r\nsong arrangements.\r\nSinger Michael Stipe's lyrics dealt with the nature of celebrity, which he sang while \r\nassuming various characters. Led by the single &quot;What's the Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, Monster debuted at number one in the US. The band promoted the record with its first concert tour since 1989.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbum Info:\r\n\r\nArtist : R.E.M.\r\nAlbum : Monster\r\nGenre : Alternative Rock\r\nYear : 1994\r\nLabel : Warner Bros.

You (04:53)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Music:\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the sound of R.E.M.'s previous two records, the music of Monster \r\nconsisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s glam \r\nrock. Peter Buck described Monster as &quot;a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation \r\nmarks.&quot; He explained,&quot;That's not what we started out to make, but that's certainly \r\nhow it turned out to be.\r\nThere's a nudge, nudge, wink, wink feel to the whole record. Like, it's a rock \r\nrecord,but is it really? &quot;Mike Mills told Time, &quot;On past albums we had been exploring \r\nacoustic instruments, trying to use the piano and mandolin, and we did it about all we \r\nwanted to do it. And you come back to the fact that playing loud electric-guitar music \r\nis about as fun as music can be.&quot;Stipe's vocals were pushed back in the mix.\r\n\r\nStipe wrote the lyrics of Monster in character. This, according to biographer Dan \r\nBuckley, &quot;set the real Stipe at a distance from the mask adopted for each song.&quot; The \r\nalbum dealt with the nature of celebrity and &quot;the creepiness of fandom as pathology&quot;.\r\nBuck said the album was a reaction to the band's popularity. He added, &quot;When I read the \r\nlyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don't know who they are, \r\nbecause they're not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he's done characters that are creepy, and I don't know if anyone got that. He was getting out \r\nhis things by acting out these parts that are not him.&quot;\r\nThe band noted that at the end of certain songs, they left blank choruses where Mills \r\nand Berry would traditionally sing harmonies so fans could sing along","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:888e70d04cffaed2ebf08acad6e9222e209a6975","amp;dn":"R.E.M.+-+Monster++%5Brock%5D+-+1994+%28MP3-320%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"888e70d04cffaed2ebf08acad6e9222e209a6975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,142,112,208,76,255,174,210,235,240,138,202,214,233,34,46,32,154,105,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
