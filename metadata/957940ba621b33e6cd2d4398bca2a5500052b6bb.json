Pu...sh..s | 2010-02 | ISBN: 1849050015 | 192 pages | PDF\n\n\nArt-based activities can develop presilience and self-esteem, enabling children in need to cope better with ongoing stress and loss. &quot;Holistic Arts Activities for Children and Young People&quot; offers interventions and exercises drawn from practice and research, for practitioners to use as a basis for their own arts-based groups or one-to-one sessions. Holistic arts activities facilitate a spiritually sensitive approach. Mindfulness-based exercises underpin the approach, and include guided meditations in which a group imagines that they are clouds, or draw feelings and emotions while listening to music, to encourage awareness of the senses. \n\nThe activities help the group to relax and become more self-aware, encourage an exploration of feelings, values and understanding and are beneficial for children not ready to embrace traditional therapies or counselling. This book is accessible and suitable for helping, health and education practitioners and students from a variety of disciplines, such as social work, psychology and counselling.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:957940ba621b33e6cd2d4398bca2a5500052b6bb","amp;dn":"Arts+Activities+for+Children+and+Young+People+in+Need","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"957940ba621b33e6cd2d4398bca2a5500052b6bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,121,64,186,98,27,51,230,205,45,67,152,188,162,165,80,0,82,182,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
