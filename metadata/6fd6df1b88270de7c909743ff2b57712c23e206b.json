Originally formed as a pop-punk band in Waldorf, Maryland, in 1996, Good CharlotteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½vocalist Joel Madden, guitarist Benji Madden, guitarist Billy Martin, bassist Paul Thomas and the latest edition, drummer Dean ButterworthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½have penned countless mainstream radio hits such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Anthem,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLifestyles of the Rich &amp; FamousÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHold On.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ However more importantly the band have constantly reinvented themselves and refused to limit their potential, whether that means supporting Justin Timberlake on his FutureSex/LoveShow tour or collaborating with Avenged Sevenfold's M. Shadows and Synyster Gates on their hit single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe RiverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from Good CharlotteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2007 full-length Good Morning Revival. That adventurous musical persona continues with Cardiology, an album that features everything from the dance floor-friendly first single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLike ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Her BirthdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to future GC anthems such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSilver Screen Romance,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ while still effortlessly retaining the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature sound in the process. While in some ways Cardiology is a return to form for these multiple Warped Tour headliners, it also manages to work in elements from throughout the band's classic catalog to create an album that simultaneously summarizes what Good Charlotte are all about and hints at where they are headed in the future. While musical trends can be fleeting, Good Charlotte have always proved themselves to be a constant in the music world by sticking to their punk roots without being afraid to expand their horizons and bring in new influencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and Cardiology is just the latest chapter in the band's already unparalleled career. We canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t wait to see what the second decade holds in store with Good Charlotte and share Cardiology with the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s myriad fans and supporters who have been clamoring for this record. \n\n\nTrack List:\n1.
