A pastor who has worked with the dying for three decades, Arnold knows that each of us must meet death in our own unique way. Yet through stories of people he has known and counseled as a pastor, relative, or friend, he shows how all suffering can be given meaning, and despair overcome. These real-life stories offer sure proof that even today, in our culture of isolation and death, there is reason for hope.Based on his popular 1997 book, I Tell You a Mystery, this new version has been broadened in scope to include discussion of contemporary issues such as AIDS, suicide, and euthanasia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d56b25d71e9a645f7414654e2a6f467a398d8e06","amp;dn":"Be+not+Afraid+Overcome+the+Fear+of+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d56b25d71e9a645f7414654e2a6f467a398d8e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,107,37,215,30,154,100,95,116,20,101,78,42,111,70,122,57,141,142,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
