Does not require registration (patch ChVL).\n \n2. all languages will stay available anyway once installation will be done.\n\n3. A few tweaks in the registry: \n\n- Disable &quot;Welcome Screen&quot; on the first run \n- off Auto-update (check update has been disabled)\n\n4. Picked up by an external configuration file fab_config_1.xml, if one is next to the installer \n(to be automatically copied to.  Users  &quot;username&quot;  AppData  DVDFab9). \n&quot;Quiet&quot; setting with keys / SILENT or / VERYSILENT To avoid possible errors of the program \n\n\nFile has been checked and seems clean anyway.\n\nThis is not the last final version but if all options are truly fully functionnal, then you may enjoy this new one so.\n\nUntested by me 'cause i prefer stay on the last v 9.0.7.2.\nAll other new versions don't seem very stable for me...\n\nTherefore i cannot really say if it will be completely functionnal or not.\nHopefully anyway...\n\n\nAny feedback will be welcomed \n\n\nGL\n\nenjoy and regards\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1287c6f99d16b3b5502294123053b9f154f02be2","amp;dn":"DVDFab.9.1.1.5-Final-Repack.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1287c6f99d16b3b5502294123053b9f154f02be2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,135,198,249,157,22,179,181,80,34,148,18,48,83,185,241,84,240,43,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
