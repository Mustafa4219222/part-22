Summer Pharmacy\n\nThe Skygreen Leopards are easily the most structured of any \n\nband in the Jewelled Antler stable of projects, which is not to say \n\nthat improvisation figures heavily to their sound (oh, it does). \n\nWhat you get are loosely-structured summery psychedelic folk \n\nsongs arranged with banjos, bouzoukis, 12 string guitars, tape \n\nloops, Hammond organ, and a host of other instruments. Their \n\nthird album, One Thousand Bird Ceremony, is a watershed \n\neffort for the group, and also the perfect soundtrack for the \n\nsummertime. The Skygreen Leopards are Glenn Donaldson and \n\nDonovan Quinn.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b32d539ea4e6da72e2e6fca92a8a6bc50dad0991","amp;dn":"The+Skygreen+Leopards...one+thousand+bird+ceremony%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b32d539ea4e6da72e2e6fca92a8a6bc50dad0991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,45,83,158,164,230,218,114,226,230,252,169,42,138,107,197,13,173,9,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
