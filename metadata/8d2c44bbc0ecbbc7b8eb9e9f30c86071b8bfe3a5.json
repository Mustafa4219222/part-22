They were flippant and taunting, grabbed headlines, and amassed more than a quarter of a million Twitter followers. The computer security world - and world at \nlarge - realized quickly that Anonymous and its splinter groups are something to treat with dead seriousness. Through the stories of three key members, We Are Anonymous \noffers a gripping, adrenaline-fueled narrative in the style of The Accidental Billionaires, drawing upon hundreds of conversations with the members themselves, including exclusive \ninterviews. By coming to know them - their childhoods, families, and personal demons - we come to know the human side of their virtual exploits, and why they're so passionate\nabout disrupting the Internet's frontiers.\n\n\nÃ‚Â©2012 Parmy Olson (P)2012 Hacette Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d2c44bbc0ecbbc7b8eb9e9f30c86071b8bfe3a5","amp;dn":"We+Are+Anonymous%3A+Inside+the+Hacker+World+of+LulzSec%2C+Anonymous%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d2c44bbc0ecbbc7b8eb9e9f30c86071b8bfe3a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,44,68,187,192,236,187,199,184,235,158,159,48,200,96,113,184,191,227,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
