These cultural warriors sought to recast themselves and other Jews not only as a modern nation but as a nation of moderns.\n\nKenneth Moss offers the first comprehensive look at this fascinating moment in Jewish and Russian history. He examines what these numerous would-be cultural revolutionaries, such as El Lissitzky and Haim Nahman Bialik, meant by a new Jewish culture, and details their fierce disagreements but also their shared assumptions about what culture was and why it was so important. In close readings of Hebrew, Yiddish, and Russian texts, he traces how they sought to realize their ideals in practice as writers, artists, and thinkers in the burgeoning cultural centers of Moscow, Kiev, and Odessa. And he reveals what happened to them and their ideals as the Bolsheviks consolidated their hold over cultural life.\n\nHere is a brilliant, revisionist argument about the nature of cultural nationalism, the relationship between nationalism and socialism as ideological systems, and culture itself, the axis around which the encounter between Jews and European modernity has pivoted over the past century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfd99da25265e8404d2b72d296228faae3297c30","amp;dn":"Jewish+Renaissance+in+the+Russian+Revolution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfd99da25265e8404d2b72d296228faae3297c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,217,157,162,82,101,232,64,77,43,114,210,150,34,143,170,227,41,124,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
