Brooklyn Animal Control is not your run-of-the-mill social services agency, and the officers assigned to it are not your average caseworkers... They are a breed apart. These street-hardened veterans negotiate a dangerous secret world in the heart of New York City, one inhabited by werewolves that roam the streets by night, and their human alter-egos who by day infest the hidden back rooms of the criminal elite. Which of their forms is more viscous is open to debate... but both are equally deadly!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed62b369ddec6b95c55c2e56a6aeeac1fc3edd19","amp;dn":"Brooklyn_Animal_Control_%282013%29_%28digital%29_%28Minutemen-InnerDemons%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed62b369ddec6b95c55c2e56a6aeeac1fc3edd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,98,179,105,221,236,107,149,197,92,46,86,166,174,234,193,252,62,221,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
