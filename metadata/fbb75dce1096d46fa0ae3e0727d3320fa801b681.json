DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Act Tough\n\nWhile inspired by his newfound life in Valencia, Spain, singer-songwriter Josh Rouse created his eighth full-length studio effort, now set for an early 2010 release.\n\nEl Turista thus continues where 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Country Mouse City House left off. It contains songs first popularized by Bola de Nieve, a composer often compared to Louis Armstrong, and folk music stylings from Cuba, Brazil, Spain and Venezuela.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s kind of funny, this Midwestern guy doing Brazilian songs in Spanish,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the Nebraska native said in a statement. And so he balances the album with a dash of his own Midwestern roots, primarily shown in his own interpretation of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCotton Eye Joe.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nReview by Andrew Leahey\n\nJosh Rouse has never stayed in one place for very long, but El Turista -- his third album as a Spanish citizen -- suggests he isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t leaving the Mediterranean anytime soon. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll send you postcards, boys!,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he sings during ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Will Live on Islands,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ one of the five songs to feature English lyrics. Roughly half of El Turista is performed in Spanish, and far more than that bears the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s influence, from the strum of RouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s flamenco guitar to the relaxed, siesta-worthy pitch of his voice. Rouse is still a traveler at heart, though, and he samples from several different cultures throughout the album, often devoting entire tracks -- including the instrumental ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBienvenido,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which opens the disc -- to his fascination with Brazilian traditions. Bossa nova and tropicalia are the major players, but Rouse even attempts several samba numbers with moderate success, all the while dressing up his songs in familiar layers of strings, harmonies, and minimalist piano chords. The result is a globe-trotting pop album that sounds like nothing he's attempted before, yet still retains enough of his signature arrangements (courtesy of Brad Jones, producer of 1972, Nashville, and Subtitulo, who reprises that role here) to make RouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s multi-ethnic transformation a believable one. El Turista takes some getting used to, perhaps, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a solid piece of work.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbb75dce1096d46fa0ae3e0727d3320fa801b681","amp;dn":"Josh+Rouse...El+Turista%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbb75dce1096d46fa0ae3e0727d3320fa801b681","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,183,93,206,16,150,212,111,160,174,62,7,39,211,50,15,168,1,182,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
