Tall, with dark brown hair, eyes the colour of hazelnuts and a reassuringly gentle manner, Sidney is an unconventional clergyman and can go where the police cannot.\n\nTogether with his roguish friend, Inspector Geordie Keating, Sidney inquires into the suspect suicide of a Cambridge solicitor, a scandalous jewellery theft at a New Year's Eve dinner party, the unexplained death of a well-known jazz promoter and a shocking art forgery, the disclosure of which puts a close friend in danger. Sidney discovers that being a detective, like being a clergyman, means that you are never off duty. Nonetheless, he manages to find time for a keen interest in cricket, warm beer, hot jazz and the works of Tolstoy and Shakespeare - as well as a curious fondness for a German widow three years his junior.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e57e7e2ace8f17352c96c5ea2e66f4b5e5a4d725","amp;dn":"Sidney+Chambers+and+the+Shadow+of+Death","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e57e7e2ace8f17352c96c5ea2e66f4b5e5a4d725","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,126,126,42,206,143,23,53,44,150,197,234,46,102,244,181,229,164,215,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
