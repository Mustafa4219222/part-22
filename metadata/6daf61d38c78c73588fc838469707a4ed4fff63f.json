Their quirky, whimsical style has drawn comparisons to the Flaming Lips. This band is no Flaming Lips, but on Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone?, the Unicorns create a wonderful and addictive lo-fi pop record. The lyrics are at times just downright silly, and as their name implies, this is not a band that has it's feet planted too firmly in the ground. In fact three of the first four songs contain references to ghosts in the titles. This is by no means a serious album, but has it's moments of greatness, and is a good pick me up album.\n\n1.
