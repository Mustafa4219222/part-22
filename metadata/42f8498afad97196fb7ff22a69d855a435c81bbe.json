However, the album had bigger, more emotional moments mixed in that felt like the promise of something different, and on the band's sophomore effort, Close the Distance, the band makes good on that promise. Overall, it feels like Go Radio have settled into their sound, giving the album a more relaxed sound that finds them opting to make their songs bigger rather than faster. This gives Close the Distance a mellow, more plaintive vibe that their debut, attempting to wash over listeners rather than simply bowl them over. While this means the album lacks the teeth of its predecessor, it allows the band to focus more on reflection, and provides the songs with a greater sense of depth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f8498afad97196fb7ff22a69d855a435c81bbe","amp;dn":"Go+Radio+-+Close+the+Distance+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f8498afad97196fb7ff22a69d855a435c81bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,248,73,138,250,217,113,150,251,127,242,42,105,216,85,164,53,200,27,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
