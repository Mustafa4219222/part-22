The Lion, the Leopard and the Wolf]\n\n\nAction / Horror\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103841/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103841/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n&quot;Bloodlust is a spectacular achievement. Richard Wolstencraft and Jon Hewitt's opus is a very fine film of its own accord, however its importance ultimately lies in the fact that it is an example of that rarest of breeds - an Australian film with balls. Bloodlust spits all over the dreary crap that regularly gets churned out with the assistance of funding bodies. At the time of its release, this film was a much needed shot of adrenalin in the arm of the limp and pathetic Australian independent film-making scene.&quot;\n\n&quot;The film revolves around three blood drinking killers - Tad, Frank and Lear. Our three heroes spend most of their time having sex and murdering people, although not necessarily in that order. When the local stake wielding religious fanatics almost succeed in killing Tad, the lovely threesome decide to rob a casino and retire. This sets off a chain of events that result in Tad and his ladies being chased by police, mobsters and the religious slayers. Bloodlust does not waste a second of its running time being boring. If someone is not being mutilated or having sex, then one of the characters is spewing out a tasteless joke. In fact, Bloodlust is a very funny movie. The screenplay is wonderfully literate and the humour, while not exactly subtle, is dark and pointed.&quot;\n\n\nCo-director Jon Hewitt described it as:\n&quot;A purpose-made, market-driven, crass, exploitation film. It isn't particularly good but, for me, it was really my film school. It's where I taught myself how to make a feature film and made a lot of mistakes on it - but I tried to learn from them.&quot; Filming took six weeks and was very difficult, with one member of the cast being arrested on drug charges. However Hewitt says it proved profitable.\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 688x512, 25.000 fps, 2109 kbps, 01h22m43s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 128 kbps\n\nDVDRip but appearance more VHS like, no subtitles\n\nDUAL AUDIO:\n1) English movie track\n2) English commentary track\n\nEXTRAS:\n1) bloopers, outtakes . . . 40 minutes, 331 MB\n2) deleted scenes . . . . . 17 minutes, 146 MB\n\ncover: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/66mf65c4f/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/66mf65c4f/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vt8kzf15r/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/vt8kzf15r/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lgmadc7mn/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/lgmadc7mn/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/80z9nvz4v/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/80z9nvz4v/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/x9k3hk42n/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/x9k3hk42n/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:494475e63582988c4d75adbcf73a7f466e3757b7","amp;dn":"Bloodlust+%281992-Australia%29+%5Bjunkie+vampire+cult+Horror%5D+Extras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"494475e63582988c4d75adbcf73a7f466e3757b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,68,117,230,53,130,152,140,77,117,173,188,247,58,127,70,110,55,87,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
