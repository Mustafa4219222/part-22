Duets showcases her ability to bring out the best in other singers, though its grab-bag selection doesn&amp;#039;t necessarily showcase Harris at her best. Released to capitalize on the success of her initial Trio project with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt, it compiles her collaborations with a variety of artists from the late Parsons (their riveting rendition of &quot;Love Hurts&quot;) to Southern Pacific (&quot;Thing About You,&quot; a Tom Petty obscurity) to George Jones (&quot;All Fall Down,&quot; an album highlight) to Don Williams (their hit duet of Townes Van Zandt&amp;#039;s &quot;If I Needed You&quot;). From the sublime (Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson) to the irrelevant (John Denver, Earl T. Conley), the collection is more of a marketplace filler than a cohesive artistic statement\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n? Artist:    Emmylou Harris\n? Title:     Duets\n? Year:     1990\n?
