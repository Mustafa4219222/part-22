Bridging the gap between physics and astronomy, this is the first integrated graduate-level textbook on atomic astrophysics.\n\nIt covers the basics of atomic physics and astrophysics, including state-of-the-art research applications, methods and tools. The content is evenly balanced between the physical foundations of spectroscopy and their applications to astronomical objects and cosmology.\n\nAn undergraduate knowledge of physics is assumed, and relevant basic material is summarised at the beginning of each chapter.The material is completely self-contained and features sufficient background information for self-study. Advanced users will find it handy for spectroscopic studies. A website hosted by the authors contains updates, corrections, exercises and solutions, as well as news items from physics and astronomy related to spectroscopy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02aa8a3f3c6c03bce724de3d93b23ac70bee114f","amp;dn":"Atomic+Astrophysics+%26+Spectroscopy+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02aa8a3f3c6c03bce724de3d93b23ac70bee114f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,170,138,63,60,108,3,188,231,36,222,61,147,178,58,199,11,238,17,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
