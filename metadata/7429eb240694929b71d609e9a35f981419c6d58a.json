Years of experience have made Joey an expert, if unsatisfied, card player.\n\nOne night, during a round of drinks, he is pushed into a proposition that sees him buy the souls of thirty-two people for the price of one free beer each. It isn't long before those who sold their souls are suffering fatal accidents one by one, and the forces of Heaven and Hell show up trying to put a price on the purchased souls for themselves.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo me this is still Willingham kicking around ideas in his head that are bringing him closer to the world of Fables. The weird, slightly 'off' feeling to a world that is still grounded in reality is there, it's just not being done with fairy tale characters as part of the story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7429eb240694929b71d609e9a35f981419c6d58a","amp;dn":"Bill+Willingham+-+Proposition+Player+%28Vertigo%29+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7429eb240694929b71d609e9a35f981419c6d58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,41,235,36,6,148,146,155,113,214,9,233,163,95,152,20,25,198,213,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
