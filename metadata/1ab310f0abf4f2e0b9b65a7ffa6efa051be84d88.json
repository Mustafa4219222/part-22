Long sequences that follow a maid who knifes her mistresses to death as she goes from house to house. &quot;This is a very strong film, Maria Gladys and Helena Ignez are wonderful, it is a sort of more intimate Matou a FamÃƒÂ­lia, as though it were a Super 8. At the time, the film had the effect of a knife blade. The theme is the slaves' revolt, the downtrodden who, since they don't have any prospects, decide to transform ten, twenty days into an eternity. And so they kill their masters. They end up dying, but that moment of liberty, even if it was just one week, for them was an eternity. The color was very important, it's like a Super 8 Polaroid, but made with sophisticated technology, Ã¢â‚¬Â¦clair 16 mm, NagraÃ¢â‚¬Â¦&quot; (J. Bressane).\n\nSource: TV Rip\nContainer: MKV\nVideo Codec: H.264\nVideo Bitrate: 2650 Kbps\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256 Kbps\nResolution: 660x480\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nSize: 1,45 Gb\nDuration: 71 min.\nSubtitles: None\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182024/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182024/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab310f0abf4f2e0b9b65a7ffa6efa051be84d88","amp;dn":"Cuidado+Madame+%28Julio+Bressane%2C+1970%29.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab310f0abf4f2e0b9b65a7ffa6efa051be84d88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,179,16,240,171,244,242,224,185,182,90,127,250,110,250,5,27,232,77,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
